        1. Introduction & agreement Name of service: “Photobookers” (and
        optional legal entity name). These terms govern use of the website and
        services. By registering or using the site, users agree to these terms
        (and you can reference the checkbox at registration). If the user is
        under 18 (or 13 if you target younger users), they need parental consent
        or must not use the service (state your minimum age). 2. Definitions
        User / Account: anyone with an account. Creator / Artist / Publisher:
        users who upload and manage books. Fan: users who follow, wishlist, and
        collect. Content: any text, images, data, or other material uploaded or
        shared on the platform (including book listings and creator profiles).
        3. Accounts Users must provide accurate information and keep it updated.
        Account is personal; no sharing credentials or impersonation. Users are
        responsible for activity under their account. You may suspend or
        terminate accounts for breach of terms or for other stated reasons (e.g.
        illegal content, abuse). 4. User-generated content (UGC) Creators: They
        retain ownership of their content (books, images, text) but grant
        Photobookers a license to use, store, display, and distribute that
        content to operate the service (e.g. show books, feeds, search). They
        confirm they have the rights to upload the content (no infringement of
        others’ IP or personality rights). All users: Must not upload illegal,
        defamatory, harassing, or infringing content. You reserve the right to
        remove content and suspend/terminate accounts without notice if content
        violates terms or law. 5. Acceptable use No: spam, scraping, bots
        (unless you explicitly allow), impersonation, harassment, illegal
        activity, circumventing security or access controls. Use of the service
        only for lawful purposes and in line with these terms. 6. Intellectual
        property Photobookers (or your company) owns the site, design, branding,
        and any non-user content. Trademarks and logos may not be used without
        permission. DMCA / copyright: how to report infringement (contact email,
        what to include), and that you may terminate repeat infringers. 7.
        Privacy Reference your Privacy Policy (e.g. “as described in our Privacy
        Policy”) for collection, use, and sharing of personal data. Short note
        that data may be processed in [your hosting region] and that signing up
        implies consent where required. 8. Disclaimer of warranties Service
        provided “as is” and “as available.” No warranty of uninterrupted,
        error-free, or secure operation (unless required by law in your
        jurisdiction). 9. Limitation of liability To the maximum extent
        permitted by law, Photobookers (and its operators) are not liable for
        indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, or for loss of
        data, profits, or business. Cap liability at [e.g. amount paid in the
        last 12 months] or [a fixed amount], as allowed in your jurisdiction.
        (EU/UK consumers often get different treatment—lawyer can adapt.) 10.
        Indemnification Users agree to indemnify and hold Photobookers harmless
        from claims, damages, and costs arising from their use of the service,
        their content, or their breach of terms. 11. Changes to terms You may
        update the terms; continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
        For material changes, you will notify users (e.g. email or prominent
        notice on the site) and, where required (e.g. EU), give advance notice
        and option to object or terminate. 12. Termination Users may close their
        account (how: e.g. in account settings or by contacting you). You may
        terminate or suspend accounts as set out in these terms. Effect of
        termination: right to use the service ends; clauses that by nature
        survive (e.g. IP, liability, indemnity, dispute resolution) continue to
        apply. 13. General Governing law and jurisdiction: e.g. “Governed by the
        laws of [Country/State]. Disputes resolved in the courts of
        [City/Country].” Severability: if one clause is invalid, the rest remain
        in effect. Entire agreement: these terms (plus Privacy Policy and any
        other referenced policies) are the full agreement regarding the service.
        14. Contact How to contact you for terms-related questions, copyright
        reports, and support (email and/or address).
