'I set out on foot across the network of trails through France and Spain to experience the increasingly popular phenomenon of longdistance pilgrimage. I walked continuously for three months, beginning at the town of Le Puy en Velay in eastern France, and ending 1700km later at the town of Muxia on the west coast of Spain.
Along the way I made many transient friendships with other pilgrims. Although some were walking for religious purposes or the physical challenge, most of those that I encountered were walking to overcome a major event that had happened to them, or to find something that was missing from their life. Walking facilitated new relationships as we talked side by side. Sharing the experience of being in unfamiliar places and having to find our way brought about a unique connection with those I had only just met. The monotony of walking day after day, the physical discomfort and the sense of isolation were made more bearable when not alone. Daily rituals such as eating and finding a place to sleep took on another meaning; they became goals to be strived for and shared.
After months of walking with my belongings on my back I discovered that, through separation from all that is familiar, walking helped people to find liberty from their complex identities and social obligations back home. The path seemed to untether people, draw them together and give them a common goal. The surrounding landscape became a geographical space for self-reflection and change.
The photographs I made during those three months not only depict the people and landscapes that I encountered but are also intended to convey the transformations that were taking place within me as I walked.'

---------------------------------------------------------------------
In the spring of 1926 Cecily Nash called off her engagement to her fiancée, Christopher Marlowe.
It’s not clear how they first met but it’s thought that it was sometime in 1924 whilst Christopher was a guest at her family’s hotel on the Norfolk coast. Cecily was a teenager, the youngest of three sisters, coming of age in a period of newly found freedoms for young women. Older than her, he was a Cambridge graduate but not without having had his studies disrupted by the Great War, during which he’d served on the Western Front. By the time their paths crossed he was an aspiring writer, working on his first manuscript, The Fen Country.
The book, published in 1925, documents his bicycle tour of East Anglia interwoven with a history of the area. His affection for the landscape of the Fens and the people he met on his travels is palpable. But all that remains of his romance with Cecily is the inscription in a copy of the book he gave her. It reads:
To my dearest fiancée with devoted love From The Author
The descendants of those who settled in the Fens a thousand years ago have a word for his euphoria. Forelsket.
No one knows why Cecily changed her mind, but by 1928, aged 21, she had married someone else and in 1929 would give birth to her only child. This child, Pamela, was my mother. In the same year Marlowe’s article A Tour in English Fenland would appear in the May edition of The National Geographic Magazine, alongside some of the earliest colour photographs of the United Kingdom.
Through the depiction of the contemporary landscape about which Marlowe wrote so vividly, I hope this collection of photographs, which were taken during between 2020 and 2023, will evoke the story of their relationship. The copy of The Fen Country, with its inscription to my grandmother, was used as a map to plot my journey through the Fens whilst I reflected on the love that they once shared, and the impact of her decision on my own life.
The original copy of the love poem, Castle O’ Dreams, was found alongside the book, presumably written for Cecily by Marlowe. His desire to find love was perhaps, in no small part, a result of the death and destruction he experienced on the battlefield. In many ways his journey through the Fens reads as an escape from the horrors of war. It’s easy to see his love for my grandmother as an attempt to experience the very best of the human condition in the shadows of the very worst.
Marlowe’s book has drifted into obscurity, a relic of the past, but my copy has defied time. It remains as moving in its dedication today as it was when first given to Cecily. A simple gesture from one lover to another, yet a poignant reflection of our own individual quests for forelsket.

Light is a necessity and a preoccupation for the work I make. It fascinates me that one day there won't be any and the universe will return to darkness. This work is about endings, and, of course, new beginnings. but also about identity and place. Not only my own physical place in the aforementioned uncaring, utterly indifferent universe, but the landscape I've been inhabiting and closely experiencing for the last three years making this body of work.  Being mindful and ultimately present in the landscape and allowing myself to be swept along with it, the subtle changes that occur over the seasons and with the passage of time. Some of the places I visited (often multiple times over the years) are not even there any more, certainly not in the state I photographed them in originally. There's an element of mourning to the loss of a place one feels compelled to photograph, though I understand some of these places were never meant to be anything but transitory. For me, it raises the question of why I photograph and what I'm unconsciously trying to achieve by making a record of it in the first place? There are so many reasons obviously, visually, mentally, how a place makes me feel and how I feel when I photograph that same place. Then I try to convey that meaning to the viewer in the hope there's at least a vague connection between us. Isn't that what this is, or at least should be, all about? Small personal interconnections made possible by the imperfect medium of photography? Perhaps it doesn't matter or is the only thing that matters.

In the 1950s, amidst the rise of the communist regime in Bulgaria, the construction of what would become known as the chemical valley of the country began. What was once a shining example of the opportunities and hopes of the socialist order, now lives with the consequences after it’s fall.
'Along The Swift Current Of Time' explores how the intense industrialisation in Devnya has affected the landscape and, inevitably, has become part of it. Large deposits resemble hills, overlooking the valley, as a turquoise river flows alongside the town, suggesting how chemical waste has woven itself into the fabric of the landscape.

Flookburgh fishermen never say they are going fishing just that they are ‘Going to the Sand’. They travel where they need to by ancient tractors, negotiating tides and constantly changing sands and channels.
For over 30 years, I have photographed rural life, working closely with individuals and communities to investigate how the landscape is shaped by humans. From hill farmers near my home in North Yorkshire to Icelandic puffin hunters, from Romanian nomadic shepherds to artisan flower growers my projects reveal the fascinating intricacies of the dependencies between people, work and the land.
As a photographer, sometimes people and places just get to you. Morecambe Bay has been like that for me. Over four years ago a chance meeting with two of Flookburgh’s handful of remaining fishermen has led to this series of photographs.
During this time I have spent many days 6 miles out on the Sand with the fishermen in all seasons and all weathers. I learnt about craams and riddles, tide tables and bye-laws, shrimping, musselling and cockling, fishing with all kinds of nets. These skills have been passed down through generations of fishermen, all with the backdrop of the beautiful but often harsh landscape of the Bay.
During this relatively short space of time regulations have changed resulting in many of my photographs documenting the end of several eras.
These photographs were produced between August 2018 and November 2021.
The book includes a historical section made in collaboration with fishing writer Mike Smylie and an ‘in conversation’ with Colin Pantall.

Walking, watching, reacting…
One day you’ll make the last photograph you will ever make.
The shutter will fire for the last time. What will your last ever photograph mean? Surely, as it’s the last one, it will be special? You probably won’t know. Unless it’s a conscious decision, you won’t be around to see it. Maybe no one ever will ever see it.
It’s most likely that the landscape I’m inhabiting will still be there long after I’m gone. I’m trying to comprehend this. The massive amount of time during which its contours are moulded by both natural and unnatural manipulation.
I find it extremely comforting to know that after I’ve made my last photograph of the landscape it will continue to exist. It will change as nature claims it and humankind alters it.
‘As We Wander’ is about the solidity of my surroundings and my own fluidity. I am a visitor for an all too brief time. I will end. You will end. The landscape will remain.

“I have learned that if you must leave a place that you have lived in and loved and where all your yesteryears are buried deep, leave it any way except a slow way, leave it the fastest way you can.”
Beryl Markham
My parents, like so many others of their generation, would leave one home to go in search of another. Traveling across the seas from Jamaica, to find a new life in the motherland, a space broken by war.
From A Small Island is the first in a trilogy of works examining the legacies of this journey to the UK, with a focus on the post-war period to Brexit.
While From a Small Island gives an introduction and overview of the trilogy, it is also a self-reflection and meditation on my personal attempts, as a man born in Britain to Jamaican parents, to connect with the land of their birth.
Immigrants, as current times so clearly show, often sail treacherous waters, drawn by the ebb and flow of political whims which call them to do the jobs others don’t want and then demonise and banish them when economies falter.
Through all of this, whilst my parents arrived as British citizens, they were always seen as Jamaican even though Jamaica was a place to which they would never return.
The second chapter, The Last Days of Summer, will explore the journey into adulthood of a group of young Millennial men (the grandchildren of my parents' generation), all born in Handsworth, Birmingham. The work follows them from the stock market crash of 2008 to the post-Brexit end of their youths, as Britain, in a profound time of change, reframes itself as a monoculture once more.
To conclude, the third and final chapter, From Whence We Came, explores what ultimately awaits at the end of the migrant journey for those who swapped life on one small island for another, never to return.

Simon Roberts is renowned for his large-format tableaux photographs that capture the nature of public, communal experience within specific landscapes. This new series – a taxonomic study of religious landscapes in Cuba - is his first major work to concentrate on interior spaces. His photographs form a social catalog of Cuban religious history, focusing on places of worship across Havana.
Cuba was never a deeply pious country, like some other Latin American nations, however, the Catholic church and other denominations have come a long way from the early days of the revolution when Fidel Castro enshrined atheism in the constitution and Christians were persecuted and marginalized (between 1960 and 1992 Cuba was officially an atheist state).
In the absence of an all-encompassing communist state and in a post-Castro era, religious practice in Cuba has been allowed to grow and forms an important part of contemporary Cuban society. Although officially a secular state there is a rapid spread of evangelical denominations across the island with Baptist, Pentecostal and Methodist churches increasing their congregations alongside hundreds of tiny churches that have been started up in Cubans’ living rooms. Other religious groups to be found include Jewish, Greek and Russian Orthodox, Muslims, Buddhists and Baha’is. Also significant are Afro-Cuban religions that have resulted from transculturation, where the practices of African religions like Yoruba have fused with those of Spanish Catholicism.
Taking a minimalist approach, Roberts uses only ambient lighting and long exposure times to record the specific architecture and iconography of the buildings utilised by different faith groups. For instance, the Church of Santa Rita, which was completed in 1942, mixes neocolonial and modern features to create a reverent space dominated by great parabolic arches holding up the wooden roof, whilst the El Calvario Baptist Church is housed in Havana’s former circus building (built in 1881). One of the newest built churches is the Russian Orthodox Church in Old Havana, 'Our Lady of Kazan' church, was inaugurated in 2008 by the Cuban president Raul Castro in the presence of the Russian president Medvedev. The ceiba trees in Havana’s Gran Parque provide spritiual spaces for followers of Santeria where offerings to their African spirits can be found.
These sober and restrained photographs omit humans or keep their presence to a minimum. The emptiness is imbued with substance by a subtle attention to colour, and the prevailing silence is instilled with a metaphysical quality.
The book includes an essay by the Cuban artist and art professor, Ossain Raggi.

For the past three years or so, in all weathers and seasons, I have walked from my door, down through the valley and along the route of the derelict canal that runs beside the river. This is a wild and untamed hollow, where the water seeps and spills from the canal’s collapsed sides, and abandoned locks create stoppages and blockages along the valley floor.  The canal’s collapse is a wildness of reeds and weeds, yellow flag iris, saplings, catkins, beech mast, lichen, and old man’s beard. In winter floodwaters creep and spread, and the deep cold in the valley bottom traps the frost, low winter sun sending mist drifting upwards through the woods that cling to the steep hillsides.
Made whilst travelling on foot, these images pay testament to the subtle ways we are shaped by the landscapes through which we move; exploring and forming connections to the earth, and to each other.  They are about knowing a place intimately, coming to understand the shape of the land, the light, the seasons, the ground beneath, the trees above, the water streaming down the steep valley sides to reach the river. They are about the desire to fully arrive in a place.

‘... like the dream of a world that is visible before it takes shape as a reality’.
A Woman in the Polar Night
Christiane Ritter
For the time we spend with these photographs, life on any other terms feels untenable. When we are finally forced to tear our gaze away, we mourn the loss of their searing lyricism - fields of vision where everything is stripped back to its essence. This is at once the Iceland of our mythic imaginings and a reality so acutely, so urgently real, we feel it on our retinas and in our bones.

""The island is a living organism. 
Something eternally alive.
Even in the most impenetrable darkness.""
Dennis Gade Kofod
These photographs were captured on the Danish island of Bornholm in the winters of 2020-2021, where Anne Lass resides. With the project, she aims to put more focus on life out of the high season and explore what happens after dark - both inside homes and outside. The works include staged portraits of friends and neighbors, still images of nature and details of towns. The project has a documentary starting point and describes life on Bornholm in our specific time - two winters characterized by pandemic.
The images are also a visual study of artificial light situations, how light and shadows shapes people and nature and what mood the light conveys. Only present light sources have been used throughout. The combination of artificial light and the settings gives the feeling of film-stills with references to Twin Peaks, a series from the nineties which triggered Anne's own imagination about life and people in rural areas.
The narrative is kept very open and invites the viewer to use the works as a projection surface for their own memories and imagination.

For roughly 295 kilometers the river Isar runs from its source in the Karwendel mountain range of the Alps in Austria through Tyrol and upper and lower Bavaria in Germany until it meets with the Danube.
Away from the popular recreational areas and the pomp of Bavaria’s capital Munich, my interest lies in the ongoing transformation of the landscape, conducted by the river itself or by society. I document the forgotten and the ordinary, human traces in the constant process of reclamation by nature. Suburban non-places without history and identity have a communicative neglect within human landscapes. The absence of people in these photographs poses a question about the fleetingness of our intervention.
My project ‘295 Kilometers’ is the result of years of ranging the woods and fields along the river, wandering through its villages and cities and climbing the mountains surrounding its source. It is the result of searching for something I had in my mind but instead finding places and things I did not even look for.

PUSZCZA is a lyrical exploration of the Białowieża Forest, the largest surviving remnant of an old-growth temperate lowland forest on the border between Poland and Belarus. Designated as a World Heritage site by UNESCO since 1979, the 141,885 hectare forest has remained relatively untouched for hundreds of years, protected by Russian Tsars and Polish kings as a royal hunting ground. As a remaining fragment of the primeval environment that once stretched from the steppes to the Atlantic, the forest offers a glimpse into Europe’s ancient past, and is home to more than 5,500 plant species, and 11,564 animal species, including the largest population of free-ranging European bison.
Nicolas Blandin visited and photographed the Polish part of the forest in 2018, in the aftermath of the highly controversial large-scale logging operations led by the Polish government in contravention of European law during the period of 2016-2018, whose consequences will be visible for decades if not centuries according to environmentalists. Currently only a sixth of the Polish part of the forest is protected as a National Park, and the battle for the official protection of the entire forest continues. Nicolas met some of the people living, working and traveling there, in an attempt to find out what the forest means to them.

“Know ye, that on the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California very close to a side of the Earthly Paradise”
The Adventures of Esplandián, Garci Rodríguez de Montalbo (Seville, 1510)
Photographed in the city of Oakland, California, Last Best Hope is a visual essay that reflects on hope as a fundamental driving force of the human condition.
The images of Last Best Hope take reality as a starting point to create a fragmented narrative that is torn between idealism and delusion, between the search for a better life and the decay of a paradise that has long ceased to be one.

‘Black Dots’ is an exploration of mountain bothies and bothy culture throughout the United Kingdom.
Far from civilisation and mostly accessible only by foot, bothies are secluded mountain shelters scattered across the British Isles and tirelessly maintained by volunteers from the Mountain Bothies Association. Unlocked and free to use, they provide a refuge from the vast terrain that surrounds them and have become an iconic feature of the British landscape over the past fifty years. Bothies are synonymous with the outdoor experience in the UK and from day trippers to mountaineers, the growing community of bothy-users is hugely diverse.
‘Black Dots’ is the result of almost three years spent traversing our most remote landscapes in an attempt to better understand what these buildings are, where they’re located and the culture that surrounds them. Drawn not only by the primitive beauty of the bothies and the landscapes they sit within, the work also investigates the human element to the bothy story, capturing the faces of those who trek for hours to temporarily inhabit these spaces, many miles from the nearest settlements.
'Black Dots' was supported by Rab Equipment

March 23rd, 2021
It’s been a year since the pandemic broke out.
Since our lives changed overnight, and the unseen virus took hold of the world.
Behind every pause and eerie calm,
The empty cityscapes,
The absence of people,
The daily habits of disinfecting, is the endless reel of thoughts.
This is where Covid will leave it’s legacy in the collective conscious.
Our perceptions of the familiar will be approached with a subconscious foreboding.
Simple moments will be questioned and monitored.
Mental health will become a household discussion,
And a new way of life is inevitable.
For now, the old life has been left in a state of pause.
Yet in that pause is a small knot of hope and knowing.
Anticipation for a new beginning.
An emergence from this moment in history,
with a profound message to our future selves.

My relocation to Seyðisfjörður coincided with the peak of the tourism boom in Iceland. Originally from Montreal, Canada, I now live in a decommissioned fish factory in the East fjords. From 2016, I witnessed cruise ships gliding by my kitchen window almost every day in summer, the number of arrivals increasing each year.
Photographs from Looking North are a collection of landscapes and encounters I had around Iceland during this time leading up to the 2020 global pandemic.

The timeless, deep pull of the ocean is strong; nature is powerful, it will prevail. Dark tides swell and rise, awaiting those who ignore warning signs. Endure and pray not to go under – hope for a lull and weather the storm. Calm and stillness will inevitably follow. As we collide with our fate, redemption is there in nature. Mostly we don’t notice the moments of wonder and grace – but they were here all along. There are footholds in the mist, into tomorrow.
“There's something original and ambitious at work here; a shard-like hard-cutting between image and place and text. Sometimes it's bewildering -- but then that's true of the places Stewart is fascinated by as well. There's a winter-chill to the mountain photographs, and a storm-ferocity to the seascapes, that's born of somewhere between muteness and confusion.”
Robert Macfarlane

The Pacific Northwest of America; even its geographical borders are malleable. It is a landscape dominated by the Cascade mountain range, which runs from southern British Columbia in Canada through the states of Washington and Oregon into Northern California. The Cascades split the region in two; to the west, rainfall is plentiful; the sky characterised by ominous grey clouds; the earth by lush, temperate rainforest. To the east lie vast, arid desert plains, rocky mountains and infinite rolling skies.
When settlers in search of prosperity reached the end of the Oregon Trail in the 1800’s, they were forever marked by a 2,200-mile journey that traversed some of the continent’s most perilous terrain. Some even resorted to cannibalism. Those who were fortunate enough to survive the journey left a darkness that some believe still hangs over the region. Since that time the American imagination has continued to leave its imprint on the landscape. Oregon is forever haunted by the Overlook Hotel of Kubrick’s The Shining and its chilling analysis of the nation’s conflicted soul. Jack never left. In Washington State, the Twin Peaks of Lynchian fiction continue to emit mystery. The ghost of Kurt Cobain sways to a grunge beat. Cowboys still mount their steeds. Sightings of Big Foot crop up now and then. Even before settlers arrived, Native Americans built a mythology inextricably linked to the natural and supernatural elements of the land. Today, small indigenous settlements that hug the coastline still offer a window into that world. This is a region built on layers of imagined realities as much as the logging, fishing and farming industries that characterise much of its landscape. Here the American Dream, popular culture, myth and history intersect to create a narrative that is at once familiar and alien. Between Two Mysteries seeks the elusive space between the real and imagined; that place that is strange and indefinable, much like the beguiling landscape of the Pacific Northwest itself.

Le 28 août 1989 la montagne Sainte-Victoire s’embrasait. Le feu durera 3 jours et 3 nuits et dévastera plus de 5000 hectares de forêt, l’un des plus gros désastres écologiques dans le sud de la France au siècle dernier. Dès le lendemain, et les premières diffusions d'images montrant un massif calciné et méconnaissable, une véritable prise de conscience des pouvoirs publics et des collectivités va être à l'origine de la mise en place d’une profonde organisation pour prévenir, entretenir, équiper et aménager les massifs forestiers. Avec 1,5 million d’hectares de forêt et un taux de boisement atteignant près de 48%, la région Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur représente à elle seule 10% de la surface forestière de toute la France. Ce territoire est l’un des plus exposé aux incendies de toute l’Europe et avec une sécheresse accrue entre 2016 et 2017, on recense plus de 1300 départs de feu durant cette période.
On August 28th 1989 the Montagne Sainte-Victoire was consumed by flames. The fire lasting 3 days and 3 nights ravaged over 12.3 thousand acres and became one of the worst ecological disasters in southern France during the previous century. The next day, as the the first blackened and distorted images of the mountain were shown, national and local authorities would become sharply aware and usher in a deep restructuring of fire prevention methods for the protection, equipping and organising of forest massifs. With more than 3,7 million acres of forest and a afforestation rate close to 48%, the French region Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur itself represents 10% of the forest area of ​​France. This territory is one of the most exposed to fires all over Europe and with more drought between 2016 and 2017, more than 1,300 fires starts have been recorded during this period.

Dinosaur Dust was made between 2014-19 over several trips through the Mojave Desert in California. Subjects become collaborators in this open-ended narrative, both experienced and directed, telling stories of life lived with a heightened sense of mortality and longing in this isolated landscape. The work explores encounters between people and nature, playing with light, impermanence and the faculties of seeing.
Deserts stand as a monumental symbol of emptiness, a seemingly infinite landscape that serves as a powerful incarnation of the sublime. But travel through the boulders and dunes, the washes and the canyons of the Mojave and the image of virgin territory is revealed as a mirage. Just beneath the surface, the sounds and traces of all kinds of activities, experiments, myths and utopias can be heard, tales of exile and promise, temptation and death.
These desert communities offer the opportunity to begin again, providing a blank slate of sorts for people attracted to this fragile environment, to make a new life in a ruthless clime that is nowhere near as empty as it looks. Many women are drawn to the desert, often living alone, building new homes and embracing this formidable wild life. Submit to the great meteorological forces and it’s a reminder of how it feels to be alive, drawn to this edge, like someone experiencing vertigo, with an inexplicable urge to jump into the abyss.

Beauce, paysages sourds
Texte de Emilie Chaudet. 
Emission ""Les petits matins"" de France Culture du 29 mai 2017.
"" ... C’est une route complètement vide. Il y a eu du passage et puis là, pendant quelques instants, quelques heures, plus rien. Seule la pluie. Le ciel blanc. Ce sont des paysages sourds. On peut entendre jusqu’aux aiguilles d’une montre. Un rythme lent et métallique qui s’incruste dans notre paysage interne. Qui le cadence de brume et de pluie. Personne d’autre que nous à ce moment là ne peut entrer. Les portes sont fermées et les volets clos eux aussi. Comme si personne n’habitait dans ces villages. Comme si les routes n’existaient plus sur les cartes. Des herbes hautes font barrages au milieu de rails où les trains ne passent plus. Comme les vestiges d’un voyage, qui, à un moment, a été possible. C’est une étendue vide et grise, mais qui nous accueille qui nous dit que la vie ici, peut-être douce. Une bulle. Juste un passage. Ce moment, juste après la pluie. L’odeur de la terre mouillée, du goudron mouillé. Cette sensation de silence qui nous envahit. Dépasse les frontières du paysage. Cet état où l’on hésite entre rester encore un peu chez soi, ou sortir enfin. Être le premier à sortir. Etre seul sur cette route humide et calme. Cette sensation qui ne dure pas, que l’on aimerait retenir à ce moment là, d’un extrême confort intérieur qui côtoie dans une même âme, une infinie mélancolie. C’est une frontière, une bordure. D’un état d’âme vers un autre, d’une forêt vers une route, de la route à l’entrée d’un village. On se tient ici, en bordure de quelque chose. Au bord de nous même. Là où les ponts sont bien cachés. Se fondent au reste du paysage. Des ""paysages sourds"" de Gérard Laurenceau, qui n’entendent rien, nous enveloppe dans ce silence. Les saisons, le temps passent au second plan, puisqu’il est toujours l’heure de la transition, du pas de plus vers le vide, d’un éveil vertical ...""
Beauce, muted landscapes
Text by Emilie Chaudet.
Extract from the France Culture programme “Les petits matins”, 29 May 2017.
“…The road is completely empty. There was some traffic and then, for a few moments, a few hours, nothing. Only the rain. A white sky. Those are muted landscapes. You can even hear the ticking of your watch. A slow, metallic sound permeating your inner landscape. Setting its rhythm with mist and rain. At that very moment, no one else but you can enter. Doors are closed, blinds are shut, too. As if no one lived in those villages. As if the roads no longer existed on maps. Tall grass obstructs the rails no longer crossed by trains. Like relics of a journey that was once possible. It’s an empty, grey, but welcoming stretch that tells you that life can be pleasant here. A bubble. Just a passage. That moment, right after the rain. The smell of wet soil, wet asphalt. A feeling of silence takes over, goes beyond the landscape’s borders. That state when you hesitate between staying home a bit longer and going out at last. To be the first outside. To be alone on that calm, wet road. A fleeting sensation that you would like to hold on to. A deep sense of inner comfort that borders on infinite melancholy. It’s a border, an edge that takes you from one state of mind to another, from a forest to a road, from the road to the village entrance. You stand here, at the edge of something. At the edge of yourself. Where bridges are well hidden. They blend in with the rest of the landscape. Gérard Laurenceau’s “muted landscapes” make no sound. They shroud us in silence. Seasons, time fade in the background. It is always time to pass, to take one further step towards emptiness, to awake on your feet…”

Even in these times of continuous technological development, centuries-old customs are still cherished in the Black Forest, a region in south west Germany. In many villages there appears to be a deep-rooted consciousness of tradition across generations. In the past, rites and feast days constituted both compensation for and climax to the harsh daily routines of the peasants’ working year. These practices divided the Christian cycle of the year into festive seasons. Their regular occurrence structured village life and conveyed a feeling of continuity.
This project poses questions concerning the significance of customs within our plural society. Seasonal festivals like ‘Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht’ or ‘Trachtenfeste’ each require specific and regulated costumes that serve to confirm identities, but they are from a past era. As we live in a world which claims to offer infinite choices, why would people follow such rigid guidelines? Maybe these rites are kept alive to escape the demands of contemporary life within a rapidly changing world.
The Black Forest is one of the most visited recreational spaces in Germany. Festivals and religious processions are maintained and show no sign of being forgotten. Even though society has largely become secularised in the Christian world, another possibility is that these religious events have become commercialised and well established in the tourist calendar.

In 2017 a review guide declared Scotland the 'Most Beautiful Country in the World'. A statement I fully support, although I'm probably not best placed to make comment given my distinct lack of 'air miles'.
Despite my initial response being a nod in agreement, I also found myself pondering the reality. The reality is that despite the overwhelming beauty of its landscape, people and values; it has frailties in between.
Drug misuse, poverty, crime and social imbalance are scattered among the beautiful vistas. Despite not being the identity of Scotland, the presence of these issues is evident amongst the serenity.
An area that shows the diversity of landscape and life in Scotland is the Firth of Forth on the east coast. Over the past 3 years I’ve explored it’s varied coastline, making images of the scenes and people encountered and documenting the diversity of life, both past and present, that exists along it’s shores.
'Myrkvifiörd' is the old Norse name for the Firth of Forth – an intriguing name not commonly used today. It also correlates directly to the area’s physical identity as a large fjord.
The work was made between 2016 and 2019.

‘The Bridgend suicide incidents are a set of suicides involving young people in Bridgend County Borough in South Wales, UK. Reports speculated that a ""cult suicide"" was to blame. As of December 2008, there have been twenty-four known deaths in or from Bridgend county since January 2007, though police have found no evidence to link the cases together. Many of the suicide victims were teenagers between the ages of 13 to 17.’ - Wikipedia
The idea for Suicide Machine came about in 2009 whilst checking into Gatwick Airport, London for a flight. After looking at my passport the desk attendant asked, ""Bridgend, isn't that where all the suicides are?"" It then dawned on me that the town where I was born, grew up in and still live, was now infamous, nationally.
So finally in 2013 I decided to start documenting “The Town With No Hope” and the people who, like me, live there. What is it that makes a 'normal' town like Bridgend end up with such a bad reputation? On the surface it is just like any other town. In fact, it's probably a step above other towns due to its near-perfect location, lying alongside the M4 corridor, a mere two and a half hours drive from London. Additionally, Bridgend sits just ten minutes away from beautiful coastlines and wonderful valleys, and is twenty minutes equidistant between Wales' two main cities of Cardiff and Swansea.
The aim of the project is to rediscover Bridgend and determine if it’s as generic, oppressive and regressive as the tabloids and other media outlets made out at the time of the suicides. What does the future hold for Bridgend; a town that is slowly being constricted by supermarkets and out of town developments? Does happiness exist here? Why has there been an exodus of most of my friends? Is aesthetic regeneration really the answer? And also, what kind of town will my daughter ultimately grow up in?

‘Undertow’ documents the changing relationship between an islander and her home, as Frances Scott walks the coastlines of Orkney, an archipelago situated near the north coast of Scotland where the North Sea meets the Atlantic.
An undertow is a current beneath the surface that sets seaward - something which will take hold of you and pull you in, but only if you make the decision to put your feet into the water. This book - a collection of photographs, handwritten notes and map-routes - considers the nature of belonging, and how it can be formed anew, by walking the brink where land meets sea.

The bin contents are ever changing as grieving relatives decide that the flowers they leave are no longer fit to represent the love they had for the deceased. Then they are cast away on top of all the other discarded flowers and general detritus. The council workers gather every few weeks to empty the wire mesh bins and the cycle starts again. As endless as a snake eating its own tail. Sometimes there are handwritten notes with the flowers. Notes that the recipient will never see.
The bins are (to me at least) much more poignant than any grave. Each decaying bouquet or faded plastic rose meant something to someone once. Discarded tributes for the no longer here, infused with metaphor. Remember me and smile.
I walk through the graveyard most mornings. I find it a most peaceful and relaxing place. It's on the top of a hill and you can see for miles. It's beautiful. Children walk through it on the way to school. People walk their dogs there. I love the use of the space. The living mixing with the dead. When I walk through the graveyard I find myself looking at the graves with no flowers on them. The ones that never have any flowers on them. The ones so faded you can't even read the names of the people buried there. It makes me think of how one day I'll be forgotten. There's an odd comfort in that. It is the way of things and exactly as it should be.
Consider the flowers. They are there to teach you something.

""Presence, image, and suggestion: art's sacred trinity is embodied with such generous concentration in these images by Jessica Backhaus, who we as Chileans should thank for making so exquisitely visible, what we are too distracted to notice. The power of the color that portrays and crowns the subject, provokes the sensation that we are seeing something we see every day but haven’t actually seen before.”

Far Away But Close showcases work made by Jessica during many visits to Chile over the last seven years.

I have reoccurring dreams of the world’s end. Fascinating and frightening at once, they always begin with strange light phenomena in the sky. I look up, and everything I know about everything changes. I began to experiment with trying to manifest these subconscious sights, without fabricating or adding anything but rather by playing with existing light and context. While the inspiration from these visions arise from very personal experience, the curiosity as to whether others may have similar dreams is perhaps what captivates me the most. The fear of our world ending, countered with the curiosity of new and undiscovered worlds… I wonder if this juxtaposition of ideas is something that connects us.

The Tide Goes North romanticizes the existential struggle of seasonal salmon fishing while contemplating the isolating and unforgiving nature of Nushagak Bay. Using personal journal entries and photographs, the work reflects on the 2013 and 2014 commercial set net season spent on Nushagak Point while questioning the concept of sustainability between man and nature.
Nushagak Point is a seasonal community that has been tied to the land for thousands of years. Located in Southwest Alaska in the northern end of Nushagak Bay near the confluence of the Wood and Nushagak Rivers. The Nushagak River is Bristol Bay's largest of six watersheds and makeup 50% of the total watershed area. The Yup'ik people have culturally, socially, spiritually, environmentally, and economically maintained a salmon based culture for the last 4,000 years. Half of the world’s population of salmon comes from the Nushagak River Watershed.

The third and final collection of images from this ongoing long-term project.
Out of the Ordinary developed from wandering, exploring, discovering, and observing – slowing down and spending time in everyday places.  It reflects my interest in human landscapes and the way we interact with our surroundings - through it I have developed a passion for documenting the overlooked, for finding visual interest in seemingly ordinary locations.
As with the previous two volumes, this collection contains work from across the country, city centres to remote communities - a personal portrait of everyday Scotland.

In 2015, the UK Government passed the Modern Slavery Act, a new piece of legislation which would raise awareness of the existence of slavery in the 21st century, while highlighting the growing number of cases of forced labour, human trafficking and sexual exploitation across the country. In 2017, the National Crime Agency (NCA) included 5,145 potential victims of modern slavery in their Strategic Assessment, nearly 2,000 more than in 2015. This number is determined by victims who have been encountered by authorities, and further testify, but does not include potential victims who either do not testify, or who are not known to the NCA.
The hidden nature of modern slavery makes it likely that many such cases are unknown. By analysing the overlaps between known cases, statistician Professor Bernard Silverman has estimated “the dark figure” of cases that have not yet come to attention. This estimation concludes there are between 10,000 and 13,000 potential victims of modern slavery in the UK today.
The Dark Figure* documents neighbourhoods where modern slavery crimes have taken place. Information has been included wherever possible, but can be limited as cases unfold. I hope that by presenting a case-by-case geographic study, we are able to find meaning in this new coined phrase “modern slavery”, so it is at least possible to consider what might be involved in Bernard Silverman’s “the dark figure”.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Moor depicts a fictionalised dystopian future situated on the bleak moorland landscapes of Dartmoor. Drawing on childhood memories of Dartmoor alongside influences from contemporary culture, the narrative references local and universal mythology to give context but suggests something altogether more unknown. The realisation of this dystopian future is specifically in response to a perceived uncertainty of life in the modern world and a growing disengagement with humanitarian ideals. The Moor portrays an eerie world that shifts between large open vistas, dark forests, makeshift dwellings, uncanny visions and isolated figures. 
 
The sense of an on-going narrative is reinforced by the reoccurrence of characters, often appearing on edge, in peril or distressed. The inherent wildness of the landscape heightens this fragile sense of existence, with the suggestion of an unseen presence adding to the isolation and tension.
The fiction is grounded within the landscapes of Dartmoor, using found locations instead of overt staging, artificial lights or constructed sets. Shifting between pseudo documentary and constructed photography the Moor blurs that liminal space between fiction and reality.

Doggerland.
Waves crash.
LOVER OF STRANGERS
A path cuts through the worn grass.
I KNOW I HAVE LOST
Now the advertising posters dance, shimmer on glass, huge as the buildings.
EVERYTHING NOW PLEASE
...and we find a layering of screens, of silhouette that doesn't quite make itself out; a cross now in a field.
GOLD IN MY HEAD
Jesus... A flag ; a knotted scarf ; a book (but framed, cased under glass)...
Symbols?  We might reflect on that.  
  
Simply?  This is a complex joined-up narrative of elements perceived through glass – this is found images, but images all looked-for : sought, perceived even a little in advance, where the right picture is thus in itself its own reflection.
Something of all that is what you see with eyes half-silvered anyway – is no more than just that thing which we all call photography.
But this is something more than that.
For this is Doggerland.

“It is precisely what is invisible in the land, that makes what is merely space to one person a place to another.”  
Yi-Fu-Tuan
Water is at the heart of the Somerset Levels. Once sea, it has gradually become land through a succession of salt marsh, freshwater wetland and rich summer pasture. Human intervention has seen rivers diverted, bogs drained and an intricate network of ditches, sluices and sea defences installed to keep the water at bay.
In recent years this land, damaged by drainage, agriculture and intense peat extraction, has been returned to marsh, creating a ‘new’ ancient landscape of water filled rhynes, damp fens, wet fern woodland, salt marsh and open water, fringed with reed beds.
I visited this landscape at a time in my life when loss and uncertainty had become very present. It became a place to reflect, a place of silence and recollection. The fluid and shifting nature of this ancient landscape spoke to me of the past and also of presence, that life is transient but also constant, that the past can be tangible as well as elusive.
These photographs tell the story of this watery landscape, tracing encounters with the changing of the seasons, the gradual return of marsh flora and fauna, the contant shifting of light, weather and tides; a reflection on the nature of impermanence and of transformation.

This is the story of a former Soviet republic landlocked in central Asia, Kyrgyzstan, home to six million people, esteemed for its nomadic traditions, its yurts, its horses, its breathtaking mountainous landscapes and steppe… It holds a less perceptible decor, less alluring perhaps, distant from the stereotypes and necessary embellishments that followed the impenetrable era of the USSR. So how come such photos? These images of desolate landscapes, these troubling portraits of minors, work-ers, students and elders, these reflections of villages fallen into abeyance, and that sky – that Kyrgyz sky that perpetually seems to give more depth to the many narratives that unfold under its intensity?
These photos are but fragments of reality – facts – in an attempt to reconstitute a concealed story, shattered to pieces, so difficult to gather and put together. With what is left of its broken dreams and surprising vitality, the young republic of Kyrgyzstan is a contradictory Neverland where great aspirations cross paths with remnants of a Soviet era that seem, somehow, frozen in the country’s landscapes and in its people’s minds. A society rooted in environments where pain and isolation come into contact with a somewhat silent resignation. Elliott Verdier’s images not only show the echoes of a wounded past, but of one that has been forgotten, that lurks under the surface, ready to rear its head if only someone paid more attention.

Built in 1928, ’Bwlch-y-Clawdd’ (Gap in the Hedge) is a mountain pass (450m) that connects the Rhondda Valley - In South Wales - to the town where I was born and still live, Bridgend. It is also connected to the Afan Valley via the A4107, which leads through to the coastline and industrial town of Port Talbot. The Bwlch road itself is the A4061, which stretches approximately 25 miles.
Not only did the pass offer a lifeline to the isolated valleys, and present greater job opportunities for the local people but it also provided an essential shortcut for valley based industry; predominantly coal related. My parents used the pass themselves to make their own move to Bridgend in 1966; starting their own business there shortly after.
Loosely based around nostalgia, ‘Gap in the Hedge’ reflects on a journey I used to make with my Mother to visit relatives in the Rhondda Valley, every Saturday when I was a small boy. It was my first taste of a road trip and I can recall almost every inch of the journey. I’d sit there in the front seat of my Mother’s little red car utterly absorbed and mesmerised by the forests, terraced houses and falling rock warning signs. The journey seemed to take forever, but we were only ever around 30 minutes from home.
This series not only attempts to document the beauty of this iconic piece of South Wales landscape, but also explores the relationship that the people - whether locals, tourists or workers - have with the landscape and environment. And ultimately, what lies ahead for this part of South Wales following Brexit and the abolition of EU funding. The immediate villages of Nantymoel and Cwmparc - both of which are former mining communities - either side of the mountain, are incorporated into the project, as the pair both sit in the shadow of  ‘The Bwlch’.

Technology is restructuring our communication methods, transforming our perceptions and interactions with our environment, and rendering the physical realm comparatively cumbersome and slow. Disconnected from the modern digital world, these material structures and the systems in which they once functioned are obsolete. With the simplicity and directness of a symbolic form, each structure withholds its message, alluding to a relic from a forgotten language.
The Illusion of Purpose explores ideas of materiality, monumentality and the sculptural, questioning the relevance of the physical in our increasingly virtual age, and in a world of communication hijacked by technology.

‘Black Dots’ is an exploration of mountain bothies and bothy culture throughout the United Kingdom.
Far from civilisation and mostly accessible only by foot, bothies are secluded mountain shelters scattered across the British Isles and tirelessly maintained by volunteers from the Mountain Bothies Association. Unlocked and free to use, they provide a refuge from the vast terrain that surrounds them and have become an iconic feature of the British landscape over the past fifty years. Bothies are synonymous with the outdoor experience in the UK and from day trippers to mountaineers, the growing community of bothy-users is hugely diverse.
‘Black Dots’ is the result of almost three years spent traversing our most remote landscapes in an attempt to better understand what these buildings are, where they’re located and the culture that surrounds them. Drawn not only by the primitive beauty of the bothies and the landscapes they sit within, the work also investigates the human element to the bothy story, capturing the faces of those who trek for hours to temporarily inhabit these spaces, many miles from the nearest settlements.
'Black Dots' was supported by Rab Equipment

These huge and powerful ships assist international shipping to reach ports in the northern section of the Bay of Bothnia, across seas which are often frozen for six months of the year.

A second collection of images from this ongoing long-term project.
Out of the Ordinary developed from wandering, exploring, discovering, and observing – slowing down and spending time in everyday places.  It reflects my interest in human landscapes and the way we interact with our surroundings - through it I have developed a passion for documenting the overlooked, for finding visual interest in seemingly ordinary locations.
As with Volume 1, this collection contains work from across the country, city centres to remote communities - a personal portrait of everyday Scotland.
Out of the Ordinary is now drawing to a close - the third and final volume will be published in 2018.

Beachy Head is the highest chalk sea cliff in Britain, rising to 162 metres (531 ft) above sea level. The peak allows views of the south east coast from Dungeness in the east, to Selsey Bill in the west. Its height has also made it one of the most notorious suicide spots in the world.

I was seven years old when I first heard anything about Armenia. It was thanks to a seven-inch record played at home – Pour toi Arménie, the charity song written by Charles Aznavour to raise money for Armenians affected by the 1988 Spitak earthquake. Back then I couldn’t have known that over two decades later I would actually go there.
In 2013, my girlfriend and I received a postcard showing Mount Ararat, the snow-capped volcano that is a national symbol in Armenia. That postcard sparked a first hitchhiking trip through Armenia in September the same year. On that trip, my girlfriend and I discovered a fascinating place — a land of contrasts, laden with history. We had heard about the legendary Armenian hospitality, but we were still humbled by the level of openness and generosity we encountered. During those three weeks on the road we had the strange feeling that we had reunited with distant relatives, and we promised ourselves we would return. I therefore seized a volunteering opportunity at Spitak’s YMCA and came back in February and March 2014 to produce pictures for a guidebook presenting historically and culturally relevant sites in the re-emerging city of Spitak, which was destroyed during the 1988 earthquake, shortly before the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Armenian independence.
In Armenia, memory and topography are inextricably intertwined. Multiple layers of memory are visible in the landscape. There are, for instance, the imposing remnants of 71 years of Soviet rule, the scars of an earthquake that run deep in the collective memory, and the repositories of the memory of the Armenian genocide, which still lacks formal recognition from various governments around the world. The landscape also reminds us that Armenia was the first state in the world to adopt Christianity as its official religion (as early as 301 AD). Crosses not only appear in cemeteries and monasteries and carved in stone, but also incidentally in the shape of electric poles, shoe embroideries and, more surprisingly, in a Soviet monument (page 12). It is tempting to see the stones recurrent in the landscape as a metaphor for collective memory, for both are shaped and marked by the passing of time and historical events. The present is more elusive in this politically and geographically landlocked, post-Soviet country. But no matter how harsh the economic reality might be, daily life goes on according to its own rules and concept of time, with undeniable moments of grace and warmth.
The images in this book are the result of a personal journey. They are partial, subjective, selective, even oblique. They do not amount to a definitive vision of the country. How could they even presume to record a nation in such a state of flux? In my photographs, I am seeking to tell my own story, as well as the stories of others, as honestly as I can. Rather than documenting the history and the landscape, my approach to both is rather more poetic and lyrical. And yet, to borrow Jocelyn Lee’s words, photographs, unlike paintings or drawings, remain “mysterious but irrefutable anchors to a real event in space and time”.

Tucked in the valley within the endless Andean Mountains sits Nuestra Señora de la Paz, or just La Paz for short. A nickname that, on its surface, has no connection to the city.
The city is loud, dirty, and chaotic. Traffic laws are merely suggestions, as black clouds of exhaust fumes blanket rush-hour gridlocks and zebra-striped crosswalks. The opening-and-closing of sliding doors on taxi minivans, and the rumble of diesel engines from repurposed military buses reverberates through the streets.
Towering over the southern horizon is Illimani, with its snow-capped peak slowly melting more and more on each return visit. It is a constant reminder of pachamama, the Incan goddess known as mother earth. The winding streets and steep hills dictate a slow pace, leaving the unacclimatized pausing to catch their breath. Its unusual subtropical highland climate means dry winters are met with wet summers. The direct sun contrasts the absence of warmth, and challenges the basic understanding of how to dress appropriately.
Within this valley of dust and jagged cliffs exists a palette of colors and textures. No surface is safe from sprayed-on stencils, political propaganda and graffiti. Forgotten piles of bricks and obsolete telephone booths become permanent fixtures on street corners, just like the vending cart communities that run the local economy.
La Paz is a city that has consistently broke my heart and challenged my physical and mental toughness. It is also another home to me. Despite my frustrations, I continued to return to La Paz to try and understand a place that didn’t always make sense. These photographs serve as a tribute to the beautiful people of Bolivia and my continued search for the meaning of peace.

Twenty rolls of film lay forgotten in a drawer. I had no recollection of what I’d taken. They were originally exposed between 10 and 15 years ago.
I set about re-exposing them in collaboration with my former self, blending one vastly different life with my current existence, destroying the originals to make something new.
It’s been a unique and surprising experience. I’ll re-expose the last roll in another 15 years. See you there.

Northern Song is an excerpt from an on-going series documenting the area where I grew up in northern Sweden. It has been many years since I lived there, but I still visit regularly. It is a strange mix of belonging and alienation. People are transient: the ones I knew and loved have, like myself, moved elsewhere. Buildings, trees, a road crossing, a hut in the forest etc: they have changed but are still there and still recognizable. Although these silent photos trigger specific emotions in me, they also present a subjective yet general view of a small town area in northern Sweden.

Much of my photography is spontaneous in nature – wandering, exploring, discovering, and observing – often in everyday places.
Out of the Ordinary developed from this approach, and reflects my interest in people’s relationship and interaction with their environment. The series explores the kind of places that most of us walk or drive past every day – often places where the infrastructure of human habitation interacts with the natural environment. These are dynamic landscapes, constantly being altered, and part of the fascination for me is the element of chance involved – stumbling upon scenes that often look very different the following month, day or even hour.
The project is on-going and for me has become a journey through everyday Scotland.

Føroyar is about life in remote and sparsely populated villages on the Faroe Islands, an archipelago in the middle of the North Atlantic, halfway between Scotland and Iceland.
In February 2016 I immersed myself within the Faroese community, I couch-surfed and hitch-hiked my way across the islands, finding doors opening to me everywhere I went. Here, across swathes of snow-veiled landscapes and bordered by dramatic coastline, villages are slowly dropping into decline as more and more of their inhabitants are emigrating from the islands in pursuit of greater opportunities.
Though at times lonely and perpetually freezing, I learned to appreciate the small, simple comforts of life – listening to stories told in the welcoming warmth of Faroese homes, the sound of songs against the roaring backdrop of the sea, and my memorable encounter with a message-in-a-bottle collector on the beach.
In these clear and pristine landscapes, where villages with populations as low as ten huddle together on the edge of cliffs, I tried to reveal a community hanging on firmly to their roots and traditions, while underlining that one day these villages must inevitably disappear.

On the surface, Plain Sight is a simple study in found abstractions, ordinary objects and the spaces in between spaces. The underlying theme is an expression of a pervasive otherness.

‘The Bridgend suicide incidents are a set of suicides involving young people in Bridgend County Borough in South Wales, UK. Reports speculated that a ""cult suicide"" was to blame. As of December 2008, there have been twenty-four known deaths in or from Bridgend county since January 2007, though police have found no evidence to link the cases together. Many of the suicide victims were teenagers between the ages of 13 to 17.’ - Wikipedia
The idea for Suicide Machine came about in 2009 whilst checking into Gatwick Airport, London for a flight. After looking at my passport the desk attendant asked, ""Bridgend, isn't that where all the suicides are?"" It then dawned on me that the town where I was born, grew up in and still live, was now infamous, nationally.
So finally in 2013 I decided to start documenting “The Town With No Hope” and the people who, like me, live there. What is it that makes a 'normal' town like Bridgend end up with such a bad reputation? On the surface it is just like any other town. In fact, it's probably a step above other towns due to its near-perfect location, lying alongside the M4 corridor, a mere two and a half hours drive from London. Additionally, Bridgend sits just ten minutes away from beautiful coastlines and wonderful valleys, and is twenty minutes equidistant between Wales' two main cities of Cardiff and Swansea.
The aim of the project is to rediscover Bridgend and determine if it’s as generic, oppressive and regressive as the tabloids and other media outlets made out at the time of the suicides. What does the future hold for Bridgend; a town that is slowly being constricted by supermarkets and out of town developments? Does happiness exist here? Why has there been an exodus of most of my friends? Is aesthetic regeneration really the answer? And also, what kind of town will my daughter ultimately grow up in?

Walking, watching, reacting…
One day you’ll make the last photograph you will ever make.
The shutter will fire for the last time. What will your last ever photograph mean? Surely, as it’s the last one, it will be special? You probably won’t know. Unless it’s a conscious decision, you won’t be around to see it. Maybe no one ever will ever see it.
It’s most likely that the landscape I’m inhabiting will still be there long after I’m gone. I’m trying to comprehend this. The massive amount of time during which its contours are moulded by both natural and unnatural manipulation.
I find it extremely comforting to know that after I’ve made my last photograph of the landscape it will continue to exist. It will change as nature claims it and humankind alters it.
‘As We Wander’ is about the solidity of my surroundings and my own fluidity. I am a visitor for an all too brief time. I will end. You will end. The landscape will remain.
