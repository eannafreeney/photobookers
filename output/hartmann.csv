Goalkeepers,Hans van der Meer,true,"Football is part of our European culture and football grounds are part of our landscape; you find them in every country, city, town, village… To tell that story Dutch photographer Hans van der Meer started from 1995 on to take pictures at lower league matches, that show the world beyond as well as the game itself. First in The Netherlands, resulting in his famous books Dutch Fields (1998), and after that across Europe followed by the book European Fields (2006). The ability to casually capture the local environment became the most important factor in his choice of which matches to attend. This selection of landscapes featuring only a goalkeeper comes from his complete archive from 1995 to 2012 and includes 19 European countries.
Hans van der Meer: »Framing the scenery from a fixed and often elevated vantagepoint, half of the time the players had moved to the other end of the pitch. The remaining goalkeepers seemed to be standing on an empty stage, waiting for the other actors to come their way again. That image was always somehow irresistible; one I had to take. Bringing together a selection of these landscapes with isolated goalkeepers is a tribute to all these remote places where amateur players live their dreams, far away from the Champions League.

Gardiens de but,Hans van der Meer,true,"Le ballon rond fait partie de notre culture européenne et les terrains de football émaillent notre paysage : chaque pays, chaque ville, chaque village a son stade. Saison après saison, depuis 1995, le photographe néerlandais Hans Van der Meer passe ses dimanches dans les gradins des matchs amateurs. Ses images montrent les matchs eux-mêmes, avec les sportifs et leurs équipements, mais aussi le paysage qui les entoure, d’abord aux Pays-Bas, ce qui a donné lieu à son célèbre livre Dutch Fields (1998), puis dans toute l’Europe avec European Fields (2006), publié en français sous le titre Terrains d’Europe. Longues attentes, coups de grâce et heures de gloire : là encore, il choisit la simplicité pour mettre en avant les paysages, les terrains et les joueurs. Cette sélection de paysages mettant en scène uniquement un gardien de but provient de ses archives complètes de 1995 à 2012 et couvre 19 pays européens.
Hans van der Meer : « La plupart du temps, depuis mon point de vue fixe et surélevé, quand j’arrivais enfin à cadrer sur une attaque, la moitié des joueurs étaient déjà repartis à l’autre bout du terrain. Restaient les gardiens, qui semblaient se tenir sur une scène vide à attendre que l’action revienne vers eux. Ces moments étaient toujours irrésistibles, je ne pouvais pas m’empêcher de faire une photo. Cette compilation de scènes qu’on pourrait appeler « paysage avec gardien solitaire » est un hommage à toutes ces bourgades reculées où les footballeurs amateurs vivent leurs rêves, loin de la Ligue des champions. »

A Well That Never Dries,Nam Tchun-Mo,true,"Nam Tchun-Mo (*1961) represents a contemporary continuation of the Dansaekhwa movement, a South Korean art movement that was already working in a radically abstract, largely monochrome, and increasingly three-dimensional manner in the 1960s. Through repetitive actions in a meditative painting practice, he creates a contemporary interpretation of „golbeop“ (骨法), a classical principle of East Asian painting that emphasizes the structural vitality and life force of brushwork. He organically traverses tradition and contemporaneity, craftsmanship and abstract form, physicality and spirituality, as well as personal memories and collective cultural experience. The central formal elements of Nam Tchun-Mo‘s practice are lines reminiscent of furrowed fields and elements of traditional architecture such as lattice windows and rafters.
„A Well That Never Dries“ is the second book about and with Nam Tchun-Mo in our program after „Beam Lines Spring Stroke“ (2019) with which we venture away from photography into painting and sculpture, a rare but very welcome excursion for us.
Nam Tchun-Mo lives and works in Daegu, Korea and Cologne, Germany.

Contemporary Perspectives from NRW,Lebensräume,true,"Portraits, open-cast mining, landscape, periphery, industrial architecture, cityscapes, parks, social housing, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Essen, Hürtgenwald… fourteen photographers from NRW undertake an individual inventory of North Rhine-Westphalia in this book. Their photographic series as well as their films concern themselves, for example, with people and their diverse origins, their ways of life, and their social circumstances. Urban architecture and urban change constitute a further focal point, and naturally, the history of the federal state as a transforming industrial and landscape site also plays a role. For all these inquiries into history, memory, and change, photography in general and the photobook in particular represent the predestined medium.
Included Photographers Almourad Aldeeb, Paul Avis, Boris Becker, Frank Dömer, Emine Ercihan, Kathrin Esser, Claudia Fährenkemper, Katharina Kemme, Alexander Lackmann, Jeffrey Ladd, Melina Lehmacher, Gregor Schneider, Gerhard Winkler, Philip Zietmann.

Half Life Chernobyl,Volker Kreidler,true,"On April 26, 1986, at 01:23 a.m. local time, Reactor Block 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant suffered the worst-case scenario in the history of civil nuclear power. Nearly ten years later, in 1995, the Deutsches Hygiene-Museum Dresden commissioned photographer Volker Kreidler to document the aftermath of the catastrophe for the people, the environment, and the landscape. What began as a nature study in 2015 evolved through repeated travels to Kyiv over the past year into a highly topical testimony of the political present in Ukraine. At the heart of the 2025 works is the resilience of the people in Kyiv and the Exclusion Zone, set against the backdrop of the ongoing Russian war of aggression. “The project brings the journey full circle,” says the photographer. “We are returning to the people to whom we already gave a voice in 1995.Today, we are documenting a society standing between destruction and an unconditional determination to pursue a European future.”
With this project, Volker Kreidler presents an extraordinary photographic documentation that traces Ukraine’s transformation from the post-Soviet spirit of change to the current war of defense against Russia.
Volker Kreidler (*1962) has been dedicated to the photographic exploration of Eastern Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. His work navigates the tensions of rapprochement with the West and the associated challenges concerning democracy, education, human rights, and interpersonal relationships",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chernobyl__Cover_Gross_mockup-scaled.jpg,,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/volker-kreidler-half-life-chernobyl-en/
Abbild Kontext Zeichen Foto,Manfred Schmalriede,true,"The photo theorist, professor, lecturer, school founder, and author Manfred Schmalriede (*Pforzheim 1937) passed away in the autumn of 2023. He left behind an extensive collection of writings and lectures composed in connection with his teaching activities, as well as for magazines, exhibitions, and book projects. During his lifetime, however, no book was ever published that presented his comprehensive journalistic projects in a collected form. The foundational texts assembled for this volume were still selected jointly by Manfred Schmalriede and the editors. The organization and structure of the book were determined by Silke Helmerding (Professor of Artistic Photography at Pforzheim University) and Jörn Vanhöfen (former student of Manfred Schmalriede, photographer, teacher, and co-founder—along with Manfred Schmalriede and Arno Fischer—of the Fotoschule am Schiffbauerdamm, fas).
About Manfred Schmalriede: Studied Art (HbK Hamburg), followed by studies in History, Art History, and Philosophy (Stuttgart and Tübingen), as well as Aesthetics and Semiotics under Max Bense in Stuttgart. 1971–2002 Professor of Art and Design Theory, Semiotics, and Aesthetics at Pforzheim University; 1979–1991 Lecturer for the History and Theory of Photography at the University of Essen (formerly Folkwang School); 2000–2006 Co-founder and teacher at the Fotoschule Fotografie am Schiffbauerdamm (fas); Workshops on the theory of photography at Cranbrook Academy, MI, and Cleveland State University, Ohio; 2007 Founder of the Neue Schule für Fotografie in Berlin (International Academy for Photography, IAPh), where he played a decisive role as a board member and lecturer.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Schmalriede__mockup_Cover_Gross-scaled.jpg,https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Inhaltsverzeichnis-scaled.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Inhaltsverzeichnis2-scaled.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/354-scaled.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/246-scaled.jpg,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/manfred-schmalriede-abbild-kontext-zeichen-foto-2/
Tres Viajes,Jörg Brüggemann,true,"Jörg Brüggemann has traveled to Chile and South America three times. On one of his trips, he drove several thousand kilometers across the continent, capturing landscapes and encounters in his photographs. He was inspired to do so by a dream in which he encountered his deceased mother. On another trip, he photographed political unrest and demonstrations in Valparaíso. The three trips—there are three chapters in the book—are, in their visual language, far more journeys of dreams and feelings—perhaps also in search of himself—than documentary images of places, people, or political circumstances. The three chapters, which are wonderfully distinct from one another in their design and materiality while remaining intertwined, read like narrative strands that cannot be explained immediately, as they leave room for personal discoveries and fantasies. A short personal text by the author continues this narrative style in words. It is also interesting that the photographer, who in his last book pursued a sober topic such as the German autobahn over several years, now shows that a travel narrative can perhaps also be a healing process for oneself and that inner images enable a completely unique, not always explainable approach to the world.
Jörg Brüggemann (*1979) has been a member of the Ostkreuz agency since 2009 and is co-director of the renowned Ostkreuzschule in Berlin.

Buchenwald In the Thicket of the Ettersberg,Christian Rothe,true,"Between 2017 and 2024, the Leipzig-based photographer Christian Rothe (*1986) explored the vast area of the former concentration camp Buchenwald on the Ettersberg near Weimar, using his analog large-format camera. Ruins, barely discernible foundations, stairs, fences and paths appear as topographical scars and signs in the impenetrable thicket. What began as a careful and tentative exploration gradually evolved into an intensive search for traces of history obscured by nature. The black and white photographs enter into a dialog with the poem (Der gefesselte Wald) by José Fosty and literary passages from internationally renowned novels by former concentration camp inmates: Bruno Apitz’s “Naked Among Wolves”, Imre Kertész’s “Fatelessness” and Jorge Semprún’s “What a Beautiful Sunday”. Essays by curator Andrea Karle, chairman of the World Council of Churches, Heinrich Bedford-Strohm and editor Günter Jeschonnek on Christian Rothe’s visual language, the significance of contemporary remembrance culture and commemoration complement the examination of the rupture of civilization and the terror of National Socialism in the immediate vicinity of the town of classicism and great German poets and thinkers. The book was released on the occasion of the eightieth anniversary of the liberation of the Buchenwald concentration camp by the remaining prisoners and the US Army and was presented  for the first time at a matinee on Sunday, April 13, 2025 at the Museum of Forced Labor under National Socialism, Weimar.
After receiving the Award of the Stiftung Buchkunst as “Germanies Most Beautiful Book” of 2025 the first edition sold out quickly. With the help of numerous donors a second edition could be released on January 27 2026, the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, at the State Representation of Baden-Württemberg in Berlin.

India,Ljubodrag Andric,true,"The impressive, large-format pictures by Ljubodrag Andric (*1965) are all the more difficult to categorize the longer the viewer gazes at them. Even though Andric makes use of a camera at the beginning of his creative process, he operates at the interface between photography and painting. Between 2019 and 2024, Andric traveled through India and was inspired by the atmosphere of historical buildings to create works that can be described as geometric abstractions painted with light. A special feature of his work is the tactile quality reminiscent of fresco painting, which is also reflected in the choice of materials for this book. The publication, bound as a “dos-a-dos”, combines two books in one. The classic and equally radical layout by Dutch bookdesigner SYB congenially reflects the visual approach of Ljubodrag Andric’s works. An alternating rhythm of full-page illustrations and double-page details picks up on the impressions and sensations that careful viewers of his originals works may have.
Ljubodrag Andric, born in Belgrade into a family of artists, developed his first photographic and artistic interests at the age of 15. From 1987 onwards, he devoted himself exclusively to photography. From 1987 to 2002, he lived and worked in Rome and Milan before moving to Toronto, Canada. This multicultural biographical background has had a major influence on his work to this day.

„By noon, everything seemed to be back to normal. Another much too hot day passes before the anti-Russian law demonstrators take to the streets again in the evening. On X, formerly known as Twitter, you can watch videos of peaceful demonstrators cleaning the streets at 4 a.m., followed by videos of brutal interventions by Speznaz, the special police force, also known locally as Robocops.“
About the City Diaries
In his global, long-term project planned for 50 volumes (begun in 2013), Peter Bialobrzeski poses the question of whether the conception of the image of a city, shaped by prejudices, pre-existing notions, and media representations, can be translated into real images. He is interested in the cultural differences visible in each cityscape. He poses the question of what has already been superimposed by increasing globalization, or what remains visible. With his consistent, seemingly objectifying visual language, this epochal, documentary experiment can be wonderfully comprehended in each book and especially by comparing the individual books, e.g. for New York or Norderney.
Peter Bialobrzeski’s work has been exhibited worldwide. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including two World Press Photo Awards (2003, 2010). In 2012 he was granted the Dr. Erich Salomon Award by the German Photographic Society.

„Parts of the old town are still strongholds of the separatist movement. The people of Donostia have even created an adjective for it: etarra, which means still in favor of the now disarmed ETA, a terrorist organization whose hideout and operational headquarters in Gipuzkoa was located in this very old city. It is unimaginable today that for the majority of the people of San Sebastián, it was a virtual no-go area until ETA finally declared in May 2018 that it had “completely dissolved all its structures and ended its political initiative.“

Along the Path,Hans-Christian Schink,false,"The photo project “Am Weg” (Along the Path) is the final part of Hans-Christian Schink’s trilogy of long-term photographic investigations into the surroundings of his home in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (after “Hinterland”, 2019 and “Unter Wasser”, 2022).
A 3 km long dirt road leads from the photographer’s house through an agricultural landscape typical of this region. Hans-Christian Schink walked this path with stoic regularity, on foot and with his camera. Over a period of four years, he created an artistic and documentary inventory of the various aspects of what he saw. The results are atmospherically dense landscape images in black and white, intoxicatingly colorful portraits of flowers and graphically fascinating photographs of grasses and leaves. These are complemented by bird drawings by his brother Martin Schink. Comprehensive lists by the artist document the extensive wealth of flora and fauna observed along the way.
The charme of this project lies in the harmonious interplay of all the elements of this collection. It unfolds its effect from the harmony of all the elements of this collection of material, thus making viewers and readers aware of the multi-layered interweaving of nature and culture, even in our immediate surroundings.
A literary text by the poet and prose writer Uwe Kolbe, which traces a concrete and fictitious path through the arising associations, adds a unique quality to the publication.

Dwellings (I–III) Fragile Architecture,Karen Weinert,false,"Steely-vented hummingbird, red-rumped cacique, wallace’s fairy wren, streaky-breasted spiderhunter … enigmatic names or terms, familiar only to ornithologists. This book is about the nests of these and many other bird species, the bizarre, incredibly fragile, interlaced creations cemented together with grass, clay, leaves and a variety of other materials that birds assemble to lay their eggs, incubate and raise their offspring.
Karen Weinert’s pictures combine artistic and documentary photography, natural science and museology from the Senckenberg Natural History Collection in Dresden, which mainly dates back to the 19th century and contains an impressive collection of around 1,000 bird nests from all over the world.
She uses three different photographic methods: black and white photography in the abstract Blossfeldt style, color photography in a neutral documentary style, and scanning technology with which she scans found (abandoned) nests. The approximately 100 miniature habitats shown in this collection exemplify the immense variety of forms and construction techniques of these fantastic dwelling structures.
Karen Weinert (*1976) studied visual communication/photography in Weimar after training as a photographer and has already published several books. She runs the exhibition space bautzner69 in Dresden, where she also lives.

Bunker,Vincenzo Pagliuca,true,"For his second book in our program, Vincenzo Pagliuca continues his visual-documentary research on the archetypal images of dwelling, that began with his “mónos” series. This time he explores the bunkers of the Vallo Alpino. A network of fortifications designed by the fascist regime in the late 1930s to protect Italy’s northern border, which remained under military control until 1993. Pagliuca focuses on the structures still scattered throughout South Tyrol, where the construction of about 300 bunkers was completed with an unprecedented use of resources. The monolithic architectures thus emerge from oblivion. His images spark the viewers’ interest in distinctive camouflage methods and the relationships the buildings have developed over the decades with their natural and social surroundings. The bunkers represent a difficult legacy, recalling a dramatic historical period in Central Europe, marked by nationalist ideology and the inability to resolve conflicts through peaceful means—an era we thought had long since passed… Vincenzo Pagliuca’s (*1980) photographic practice, through a serial approach, focuses on the landscape and human intervention on the land, with a particular interest in the theme of the house and dwelling. His work has been exhibited and published internationally. Bunker is his third book. He lives and works in Brescia.

We Had a Normal Life,Ukraine 2004–2024,false,"This book tells the story of a Ukraine caught between hope and destruction, between peace and war, from 2004 to 2024. 18 international photographers turn their gaze to this period in Ukraine, starting with the Orange Revolution in 2004, through the occupation of Crimea in 2014, the outbreak of war in February 2022, and into the present. They show what was once ‘home’ to the Ukrainians, what’s been lost, and what they long to reclaim: their country, their peace, an existence without constant threat, an entirely normal life… 
The images captured by these many photographers speak in different visual languages, yet they share a common message: the deep humanity that persists amidst a decades-long conflict marked by growing brutality. It’s a moving chronicle of multiple perspectives and experiences—haunting, harrowing, and unforgettable. Photography cannot end wars, but it plays a vital role in enabling a deeper understanding, by making visible what is happening, and preserving a record for posterity of the things that have happened.

Approaching Resistance,Erieta Attali on the Felix-Nussbaum-Haus,false,"The life and art of Felix Nussbaum, the architectural language of Daniel Libeskind, the photographs of Erieta Attali—three voices, three narratives, brought together in an impressive photo book. New York based photographer Erieta Attali has succeeded in capturing the various references inside and outside the Felix-Nussbaum-House in Osnabrück, the complex interplay of architecture, museum and exhibition spaces, and the paintings of German-Jewish painter Felix Nussbaum (1904–1944) presented therein with her photographs. Attali‘s view is not documentary, but rather the subjective view of a visual poet who, in keeping with the subtitle of the publication, explores the resistance in both Nussbaum‘s paintings and Libeskind‘s architecture. The Felix Nussbaum House was Libeskind‘s first completed building in 1998, and with its provocative, unconventional design, it continues to defy visitors‘ usual expectations of a museum building. This book is intended to arouse curiosity: about Nussbaum‘s paintings and life, about the building that bears his name. And, in keeping with the wishes of the museum‘s sponsors, it aims to keep his memory alive. The cover in the shape of an N is a reference to the name of the painter who was murdered in Auschwitz.

Archipelagos of Resistance,Johanna Diehl,false,"For her series Archipelagos of Resistance, Johanna Diehl traveled to Sarajevo several times between 2021 and 2024 and photographed places and spaces in which exhibitions, theater productions, film festivals and concerts took place in the 1990s. During the Bosnian war and the siege of the city, many were used as media centers such as the Hotel Holiday Inn or the BHRT Building (Bosnia & Herzegovina Radio & Television Building). Despite life-threatening circumstances, cultural life took place in these “archipelagos of resistance” scattered across Sarajevo. They enabled the world to witness life in the besieged city. Her pictures illustrate the power and importance of cultural work, especially in war zones and times of crisis. With this series and her previous work, she investigates the cultural identity of contemporary Europe. A book that sheds an entirely different light on the question of the life-affirming, vital importance of culture and art in times of budget cuts! The project was created as part of an Ifa-touring exhibition.

"Wer bist du, Tod?","Sonja Hartwig, Nora Klein",false,"Everything that is born, everything that lives, will die at some point. Death is the inevitable conclusion of all life. Sooner or later, this realization catches up with all of us. So let’s talk about it! That is what author Sonja Hartwig and photographer Nora Klein do in this book. With their texts and pictures, they pose questions without the temptation to give universal answers. It seems presumptuous to want to portray, explain or understand death, but it is even more important to start a conversation about death. Everyday death, the death that most of us will die, is hardly ever mentioned in the media or in public. What does it look like, what does it feel like? What do we think and feel on the way as we approach it? The authors try to examine these questions with their texts and pictures. Just as this book is about death, it is also about life: To get closer to death, stories of lives are told. Eight people who knew they would not live much longer were accompanied intensively in their final days. They gave individual, intimate answers to the question of death – a canon that is unsparing, painful, tender, profound and life-changing. A call against speechlessness and a plea for a natural approach to the most natural thing in life.

24022022,Frank Gaudlitz,false,"The Russian war of aggression in Ukraine forced the Potsdam based photographer Frank Gaudlitz to add a new chapter to his long-term project on the development of post-Soviet Russian society, which he has been following since 1988. In 2022/23, he traveled to the former Soviet republics of Moldova, Georgia and Armenia, which were affected by large refugee movements and now offer refuge to Ukrainians and Russians alike as independent nations. Gaudlitz portrayed people there who had to or wanted to leave their homeland with an uncertain future. He also asked them about their fates and hopes. The intensive portraits and conversations are processed into an impressive document of this time/chronicle in this book. The emphatic, true-to-life photographs tell of improvisation as a permanent condition, the discrepancy between social promises and the everyday reality of refugees in times of war.

“This is the second diary that needs two visits to make it happen. The pandemic cut short the last trip and made another planned one impossible. Now the situation feels altogether different. Russia—well, Vladimir Putin—has invaded Ukraine with the support of his buddy Lukashenko. The weekend before the attack, both gerontopaths enjoyed war games, watching their military perform exercises involving nuclear missiles. Writing this I strangely remember how my high school class in the 1970s had to hide under the desks during frequent mock air raids. These were conducted by Mrs. Merkel, my English teacher, a little lady who had experienced the murderous attacks on Dresden by Bomber Harris during WorldWar II.”
Über die City Diaries
In his global, long-term project planned for 50 volumes (begun in 2013), Peter Bialobrzeski poses the question of whether the conception of the image of a city, shaped by prejudices, pre-existing notions, and media representations, can be translated into real images. For the new four volumes, he traveled to New York, Norderney, Istanbul and Vilnius. He is interested in the cultural differences visible in each cityscape. He poses the question of what has already been superimposed by increasing globalization, or what remains visible. With his consistent, seemingly objectifying visual language, this epochal, documentary experiment can be wonderfully comprehended in each book and especially by comparing the individual books, e.g. for New York or Norderney.

Minus Thirty,Angela Boehm,false,"White, nothing but white, is the colour of winter. When Canadian photographer Angela Boehm was growing up in rural Saskatchewan, long, cold winters were a constant and enduring part of her youth. The experience of deep winter, the silence and heaviness, the solitude in nature left her with lasting, deep memories. In 2021, she began photographing snowstorms in Saskatchewan and set herself the self-imposed rule of only working at minus 30 degrees Celsius or colder. With these pictures, she preserves her experience of winter, a season that seems to be slowly changing. In 2023, the minus 30 environment she sought to preserve did not reappear… As harsh and inhospitable as the cold, the ice, and the endless white of the landscapes appear on the surface, Boehm came to see this environment as fragile. Winter is one of the evolving parts that make up the delicate balance on our planet. The design, layout, paper, printing, and binding of this book are intended to subtly convey the photographer’s experience, of taking these pictures and of holding memories of this deep winter environment on paper.

Potsdamer Straße 50 Berlin,Ulrich Schwarz,false,"Potsdamer Strasse 50, Berlin. This prosaic address hides an icon of modern architecture, the Neue Nationalgalerie Berlin. Built between 1962 and 1968, it is the only structure Mies van der Rohe built in Europe after the Second World War. Despite the radically minimal floor plans, it is a complex spatial continuum realized with what only appears to be a simple set of tools. Mies van der Rohe’s staging is designed to fluidly shape and define the transitions between city and museum, public and non-public, interior and exterior, subject and object.
As a trained architect who has been photographing architecture for decades, Ulrich Schwarz looks for ways to translate space into sequences of images. To this end, he uses precise axial camera shifts to trace movements in space, image by image. When looking at the sequences in the book, each photograph is overwritten by the following variation; the motifs build on each other and eliminate each other at the same time. This strictly conceptual book questions our viewing habits and spatial experiences in a fascinating way.

EinBlick,Volker Hinz,false,"The third and final volume of the book trilogy dedicated to the early career of the Hamburg photographer Volker Hinz (1947-2019) will be published under the title EinBlick (meaning both “one view” and “insight”). The trilogy began in 2021 with the volume Hello Again and continued in 2023 with Carrousel, and presents his view of the world of politics, the social upheavals in the West German Republic, and the political minds in the last decades of the twentieth century, while also providing special, complementary insight into Hinz’s extensive photographic oeuvre. From the early seventies on, the great stern photographer accompanied all leading politicians on election campaigns, trips abroad, at conferences, major speeches—and, sometimes in surprisingly private circumstances, in their own homes. His pictures of personalities such as Willy Brandt, Helmut Schmidt, Helmut Kohl, as well as Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev show his keen sense for the symbolic moment, for demonstrations of power, and crisis situations, not to mention the comic situations that often took place behind the scenes. Hinz had the good fortune to be a press photographer at a time when there was still an unwritten trust between politicians and journalists, so he was often able to take pictures that are astonishingly private from today’s perspective.
The portraits of politicians are complemented by selected reports from four eventful decades. At strangely amusing yet also frightening meetings of the KuKluxKlan or the bloody street battles of the Irish conflict, in the shower cubicles of the Ruhr miners or the meetings of East German civil rights activists after the fall of the Wall and the reunification: Volker Hinz and his cameras were there. The faces of the people he observed with great empathy reveal how decisions made by politicians change the lives of each individual.
The book’s publication will coincide with the exhibition at the Bavarian State Library in Munich, which took over Volker Hinz’s photographic legacy in 2023.

Erbgericht,Andrea Grützner,false,"Artist Andrea Grützner (*1984 in Pirna) has been working on her photographic series at the Erbgericht Polenz, a country inn in eastern Saxony, for a decade. The building has fascinated her since childhood, and its name refers to some regional cultural history concerning jurisdiction, which goes back to the Middle Ages. Its interior contains a historically evolved collage of materials and spaces that have been linked to the memories and emotions of the locals since its opening in 1898. Andrea Grützner doesn’t primarily show the familiar, nostalgic scenes and stereotypes of the province, such as the tavern decorated with antlers. Instead, she elaborately stages the deserted, angled interior in front of her analog camera, sometimes using colored flash lighting. The result is an avant-garde labyrinth of intensely colorful and luminous shadow geometries that superimpose fragments of space and objects in a painterly manner, while their magical realism simultaneously refers to the subjectively and collectively colored spaces of memories as well as utopian visions of space.
The large, double-sided, abstract visual compositions, which are rotated ninety degrees in the book, create a playful, enigmatic sense of vertigo that gradually triggers a way to decipher things and perceive traces of use. The pull of this extraordinary pictorial cosmos is intensified by the implementation of the extended 7-color offset printing process and the tactile layering of different surfaces, reflecting the artist’s process.

Stages,Anna Lehmann-Brauns,false,"When someone in the twenty-first century describes photographs as painterly, this can be read as a pejorative or an ironic reference, since it was assumed that photography would replace painting as the leading artistic medium in the century before last.
However, the photographs of Berlin artist Anna Lehmann-Brauns manage to translate the painterly into a contemporary photographic language without any irony. Whether she is photographing the Bosphorus from the window of a ferry in Istanbul, interiors in Berlin pubs, gay clubs in San Francisco, dusty shop windows of Charlottenburg junk stores, or self-built model rooms, her pictures always develop an enigmatic, magical atmosphere that attracts the viewer and often suggests associations with famous paintings. While wistfulness and melancholy resonate in many of her pictures, other brightly colored interior shots radiate a masterful, cool elegance. The book’s title, Stages, refers to stages in both the literal and figurative senses, as imaginary stages for everyday occurences, while also referencing phases, as well. In her fourth individual publication, Lehmann-Brauns combines various series of unpublished works from recent years, to document a powerful creative phase.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/hb_alb_stages_U1_gross.jpg,https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/hb_alb_stages_U1_klein.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hb_alb_stages_Mockup_1.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hb_alb_stages_Mockup_2.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hb_alb_stages_Mockup_3.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hb_alb_stages_Mockup_4.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hb_alb_stages_Mockup_5.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hb_alb_stages_Mockup_6-1.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hb_alb_stages_Mockup_8.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hb_alb_stages_Mockup_9.jpg,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/anna-lehmann-brauns-stages-en/
"The End is Near, Here",Michael Dressel,false,"Michael Dressel, born in East Berlin in 1958, is a wanderer between American and German culture. His regular journeys between his home towns on the American West Coast and Berlin have sensitized him to recognize the social changes of recent decades more clearly than most locals. His second book shows his view of American society on the eve of a historic election. The Americans have a choice between sanity and madness, between an orderly civil state and increasing decay and chaos. From a Central European perspective, the choice seems clear, but to get a sense of the current state of mind of Americans, it helps to look at this book with its end-time title. Dressel’s impressive images show a society on the edge of the abyss, marked by extreme nationalism, political polarization, religious fanaticism, gun mania coupled with paranoia and pervasive poverty and moral decay. His portraits are complemented by landscape photographs that speak their own gloomy language.
Michael Dressel briefly studied set design at the art academy Berlin Weissensee. He spent two formative years in East German prisons following a failed escape attempt. After being released to the West, he briefly lived in West Berlin in 1985 before moving to Los Angeles, where he has been living ever since. Until recently he worked as a sound editor for big movie productions in Hollywood which among other things resulted in membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Since his retirement from the movie industry he shares his time between Los Angeles and Berlin when not travelling and photographing. His first photobook „Lost Angeles“ was released jointly by Hartmann Books and Gingko Press in 2022.
“The American landscape of the West displays for me the hardness and mercilessness of the universe. Sometimes you might as well be on Mars and, in a way, you are. The landscapes present the discarded leftovers of human presence. These places feel to me as expressive of the state of this country as the faces of the people I encounter. The people, society and even the landscape feel really worn.” (Quote Michael Dressel)

On the elegance of French racing bicycles,Rapidité Rapidité,false,"This selection of 22 French racing bikes from the 1930s to the 1990s does not claim to be complete. It is simply intended to illustrate the elegance, beauty and variety of bicycles designed in France during this period. The title of this publication quotes the motto of the speeding postman François from the film Jour de fête (1949) by Jacques Tati. The unstoppable human quest for faster, higher, further can also be seen in the history of French racing bikes… 22 bikes from the collections of Alexander Philipp / Subsonico and Karl Heinrich were illuminated and photographed by Niels Schubert, Stuttgart.

Ulrike Crespo Prize Laura Huertas Míllan Sarker Protick,After Nature,false,"After Nature – The Ulrike Crespo Photography Prize is a joint project of the C/O Berlin Foundation and the Crespo Foundation. Every year, the prize honors artists who explore new concepts of nature in photography and other visual media through their work. The accompanying publication presents the work of the first two prizewinners.
Laura Huertas Millán (*1983, Colombia) deals with the cultural, medicinal, and ritual applications of the coca plant long before cocaine was first produced in nineteenth-century Europe. Based on the prohibition of the plant in the course of the Spanish colonization of Latin America, she develops a speculative narrative centered on a group of women who secretly distributed coca leaves in the seventeenth century. The artist uses fiction as a strategy, imagining a fragmentary narrative about the colonial appropriation of nature and the resistance to it.
Sarker Protick (*1986, Bangladesh) focuses on the historical territory of Bengal, which today extends across India and Bangladesh. In his pictures, he translates his examination of the colonial history of the British Empire into a photographic investigation of the present. He is interested in the expansion of railroad connections and coal mining in the nineteenth century. Traveling through Bangladesh and India, he creates a body of photographs that addresses the global, geopolitical, and historical dimensions of imperialism as a key driver of the climate crisis.

Ein Dorf 1950 – 2022,"Ute Mahler, Werner Mahler, Ludwig Schirmer",false,"This book is a different kind of travelogue. While reading, the viewer travels through time and stays in the same place, Berka a small village in Thuringia, Germany. The village was photographed by three photographers of one family over 70 years – between 1950 and 2022. This unusal project – the result of several coincidences – tells us a lot about the country, the village, its people and how things have developed so far…
Coincidence: The master miller of Berka, Ludwig Schirmer, is an enthusiastic amateur photographer who, after the Second World War, in addition to his work as a miller, still finds time to capture life in the village and in the fields in pictures that are reminiscent of other great German photographers of his time.
Coincidence: In 1950, the Schirmer family has a daughter, Ute, who spends her childhood in Berka.
Coincidence: Ute marries Werner in 1973, whom she meets at grammar school in Oranienburg. Both later study at the HGB Leipzig and Werner graduates in 1977/78 with a diploma on Ute’s home village, Berka.
Coincidence: In 1997, Werner is commissioned by STERN to photograph the „flourishing Landscapes” promised by Helmut Kohl and in 1998 he returned to Berka to photograph again.
In 2001, Ludwig Schirmer dies. He had become one of the GDR’s best-known advertising photographers in the 1960. In his estate a few prints and many negatives of his Berka pictures turn up. Ute Mahler and Werner Mahler make first prints in their darkroom and realize the artistic and documentary quality of these pictures.
2021/2022, no further coincidence: Ute Mahler repeatedly travels to Berka and takes portraits of the young people in the village who were not even born when Werner Mahler last photographed there. They are the great-granddaughters or great-great-granddaughters of the people Ludwig Schirmer knew and portrayed in the 1950s.
2022/2023, the long-term project, photographed entirely in analog and black and white, has been completed and the idea for the book, which has been maturing for several years, is beginning to take shape. The writer Jenny Erpenbeck, the journalist and friend Anja Maier, the sociologist Steffen Mau (Humboldt University Berlin) and the American photo historian Gary Van Zante (MIT, Boston) describe the place, the time, the people, the photographers and the photographs. Graphic designer Florian Lamm uses subtle design ideas to develop a complex layout that shapes images and texts into a dense grand narrative reminiscent of great literary, photographic and cinematic role models and now in 2024, curious viewers, readers and reviewers can discover the many references by coincidence (or not)!

Subjective Evidence,Barbara Probst,false,"With the twelve-part exposure #1 from 2000, for which she photographed herself running on a rooftop in Manhattan from twelve perspectives simultaneously, Barbara Probst began a long-term photo-artistic project that continues to this day. The most recent, three-part exposure #189 deals with ….(human bodies with a sculptural appearance). In between, she has worked with diverse photographic themes, such as still life, street, nude, fashion, interior and portrait photography. In a constantly changing, accelerating, diversifying multimedial world, in which the call for media competence is becoming ever louder, her pictures and series sharpen the viewer’s awareness that there are many perspectives, realities and points of view – in this respect they could hardly be more contemporary and relevant.The three authors of the publication discuss the topicality and impact of the themes addressed by her pictures. The book is published to accompany a major retrospective (Lucerne, Hanover, Cincinnati) and contains, for the first time, a catalog raisonné of all 189 exposures produced to date, as well as an overview of the works of recent years and installation views of her most important past exhibitions.

Kathrin Linkersdorff,Kathrin Linkersdorff,false,"Kathrin Linkersdorff’s (*1966) fascinating large-format works resonate between art and science. Plants or bacteria comprise the visual reference point in her pictures, but it is not simply a matter of depicting them. Each image is a carefully selected, artistically staged image of the organic process of decay. The reference to Japanese wabi-sabi gives her works a dimension that transcends the visible. Wabi-sabi is a traditional aesthetic concept, according to which beauty implies the acceptance of imperfection, incompleteness, and transience.
In addition to prior works from the previously unpublished Re-Naissance, Wabi-Sabi, Floriscences series, this book presents new pictures of her Fairies and the initial, very recent pictures from the Microverse series. For this body of work, still in its experimental phase, she is collaborating with Prof. Regine Hengge and the Institute of Microbiology at the Humboldt University Berlin.
In December 2021, Hartmann Books published her first, well-received book, “Faries,” which is now almost out of print.

The most beautiful racing bicycles are Italian,che bellezza,false,"These 21 racing bikes from the Heinrich Collection were exhibited at Hartmann Projects, Galerienhaus Stuttgart between November 17 and December 22, 2023. For many years the collector Karl Heinrich was advised by the racing bike expert Roland Wolbold (Radsport Wolbold, Stuttgart-Lederberg), who also curated the exhibition together with the collector. The bikes from Alan to Tommasini, dating from 1963 to 2004, were selected from the much larger collection for their Italian origin, beauty, finesse of design and technical features. They were photographed and beautifully illuminated by the Stuttgart photographer and cyclist Niels Schubert. Each of the bikes on display is a bright, colorful example for the diversity of Italian racing bicycle culture. The majority of the bikes on display have a steel or aluminum frame with Campagnolo equipment.

Kengo Kuma – Mirror in the Mirror,Erieta Attali,false,"Japanese architect Kengo Kuma and Greek photographer Erieta Attali have been working together for over twenty years. Their joint work is characterized by a shared aesthetic understanding of architecture, space, and visual perception. In both Kuma’s buildings and Attali’s photographs, interior and exterior spaces merge and dissolve into one another. Both are united by the idea that spatial experience is fleeting, shaped by the rhythm of the day and the seasons, making built space a medium that expands into the landscape and encourages people to question their notion of spatial boundaries.
Attali’s photographs go far beyond documenting architecture. She focuses on the relationship between architecture and the ever-changing environment. Space and landscape are reordered through her visual language. Attali, who began her career as an archaeology and landscape photographer, has created a vast body of work over the past two decades. In this book, congenially designed by Koma Amok, Kuma’s architectural ideas are interpreted by Attali in such a way that the act of photographic translation creates independent works of art that can reveal their full power in this very special book/object.
Architectural sketches and quotes by Kuma are embedded in between Attali’s photographs, providing deep insights into the work created over the past twenty years. With an essay by Barry Bergdoll, head of the art history department at Columbia University and former curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art, this publication situates the work of Kuma and Attali at the center of contemporary architectural discourse.
In addition to well-known buildings, the selection includes a number of smaller, never-before-shown works from Europe, the United States, and Japan. Among them are the Glass Wood House, New Canaan, USA; the Mediation House, Krun, Bavaria, Germany; the Water Glass House, Atami, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan; Sunny Hills, Tokyo, Japan; and the Coeda House, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan.

VOID,Satijn Panyigay,false,"Minimalist photography holds a captivating allure, embracing simplicity and seeking solace within the understated. In line with philosopher Blaise Pascal’s notion that “All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone”, the minimalist work of Dutch-Hungarian photographer Satijn Panyigay (*1988) challenges the power of solitude. Her first published artist book VOID brings together the work of the past years. Captured mainly across empty museum spaces and depots, it is a dialogue between emphasized tranquility and rhythmic architectural abstraction. The photographs are marked by Panyigay’s consistent analog approach and her choice of a subdued color palette.  The radical layout concept for VOID by Dutch book designer -SYB- creates an intimate viewing experience by using multidirectional foldouts in an order moving from dark to light images. It is one of those books that you can only “grasp” if you hold it in your hands and resist digitalization.
The young photographer Satijn Panyigay (born 1988 in Nijmegen, The Netherlands) studied photography at the Utrecht School of Art, where she continues to live and work. In the Netherlands she has already had a number of museum exhibitions, but in Germany she is still a discovery.

Kuching Diary,Peter Bialobrzeski,true,"Kuching Diary, October 18 – October 26, 2023
October 18, 2023
“The Malaysian Meteorological Department issued a thunderstorm warning for Kuching and other areas in southern Sarawak this morning—and yes, the rain is pouring down. First observation apart from that: unlike I was told, the city is not that quiet.”
About the City Diaries
The city at the beginning of the twenty-first century is the major theme of Peter Bialobrzeski’s “City Diaries”. In this long-term project, he has been investigating since 2013 whether the preconception of a city — a product of prejudices, personal observations and media communications — can be transformed into a specific image. Whether Osaka or Unna, Wuhan or Wolfsburg, Bialobrzeski is interested in the cultural differences increasingly hidden by globalization, which he makes visible by means of a seemingly objectifying aesthetic. Current political and social developments are also reflected in Bialobrzeski’s images and diary entries. Cairo, for example, cannot be understood without the Arab Spring, Athens without the euro crisis, and Wolfsburg, of course, without VW and the emissions scandal. On the occasion of the publication of “Athens Diary,” Melanie Mühl wrote in the FAZ: “Everyone should see these photographs.”
The format and page count of all titles are identical. This systematic approach allows for a comparative view of different urban settings, ranging from a megalopolis like Bangkok to a Westphalian medium-sized town like Unna. Further volumes will be published in loose order over the next few years.
Peter Bialobrzeski’s work has been exhibited worldwide. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including two World Press Photo Awards (2003, 2010). In 2012 he was granted the Dr. Erich Salomon Award by the German Photographic Society.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hb_pb_diaries_kuching_mockup_U1_gross.jpg,https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hb_pb_diaries_kuching_mockup_U1.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hb_pb_diaries_kuching_mockup_9.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hb_pb_diaries_kuching_mockup_6.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hb_pb_diaries_kuching_mockup_5.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hb_pb_diaries_kuching_mockup_4.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hb_pb_diaries_kuching_mockup_7.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hb_pb_diaries_kuching_mockup_3.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hb_pb_diaries_kuching_mockup_2.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hb_pb_diaries_kuching_mockup_1.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hb_pb_diaries_kuching_mockup_U4.jpg,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/peter-bialobrzeski-kuching-diary-en/

The city at the beginning of the twenty-first century is the major theme of Peter Bialobrzeski’s “City Diaries”. In this long-term project, he has been investigating since 2013 whether the preconception of a city — a product of prejudices, personal observations and media communications — can be transformed into a specific image. Whether Osaka or Unna, Wuhan or Wolfsburg, Bialobrzeski is interested in the cultural differences increasingly hidden by globalization, which he makes visible by means of a seemingly objectifying aesthetic. Current political and social developments are also reflected in Bialobrzeski’s images and diary entries. Cairo, for example, cannot be understood without the Arab Spring, Athens without the euro crisis, and Wolfsburg, of course, without VW and the emissions scandal. On the occasion of the publication of “Athens Diary,” Melanie Mühl wrote in the FAZ: “Everyone should see these photographs.”
The format and page count of all titles are identical. This systematic approach allows for a comparative view of different urban settings, ranging from a megalopolis like Bangkok to a Westphalian medium-sized town like Unna. Further volumes will be published in loose order over the next few years.
Peter Bialobrzeski’s work has been exhibited worldwide. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including two World Press Photo Awards (2003, 2010).

Twelve Waves,Jörg Gläscher,false,"Twelve Waves—the simple title points out the number but not the type of waves Jörg Gläscher introduces in this book. In terms of physicality, a wave is an undulation that spreads out periodically, or a disturbance of equilibrium. Gläscher’s “waves” are the antithesis of this. Made with found, broken pieces of wood, these “standing” waves are sculptures constructed in the forest. These wooden waves are both the expression and the result of a long phase of unaccustomed silence, contemplation, doubt, and uncertainty, which arose during the lockdown that occurred as the first wave of the novel coronavirus swept the globe in 2019. For Jörg Gläscher, the forest was a refuge during this span of time. Out of his experiences and explorations of nature emerged ideas that led him away from his usual field of documentary photography and toward the twelves waves in this book. These pieces expand beyond the medium of photography (to which he devoted himself after studying under Professor Timm Rautert at the HGB Leipzig) but do not abandon it entirely. He documents his sculptures in photographs that contrast the isolated atmosphere of the forest with dynamic wave formations, making it possible at last to perceive the waves in all of their might and mystery.

Graubaum und Himmelmeer,Loredana Nemes,false,"Over four years and seasons, Loredana Nemes has photographed the beech trees that are characteristic of the landscape above the chalk cliffs of the island of Rügen, made famous in art and history. What began as a relaxing walk has turned into an impressive, long-term photographic observation of this “forest seascape.”
The pictures she has produced are of an ancient, archaic landscape that has survived for many generations and will continue to survive over many more in the future. They capture the quiet, the beauty, the robustness, and the fragility of the beeches set against the backdrop of the smooth, timeless horizon above the sea; and the magic of fog, light, clouds, snow, and the seasons of the year. At the same time, however, they also convey a sense of both ephemerality and hazard, because the forests are at the mercy of climate change.
Perhaps the beeches at the Königsstuhl remind Loredana Nemes of the forests in Romania’s Carpathian mountains, where she hiked as a child with her father, and this explains the profound emotion expressed in her photographs? At any rate, the beeches on Rügen are linked to the beeches in the Carpathians, for they are all part of a UNESCO natural world heritage site, the “ancient and primeval beech forests in the Carpathians and other European regions.” Rarely have we announced a book that has generated so much attention in the press and in exhibitions, as well as so many inquiries and pre-orders before it has even been released!

Porto Tolle,Francesco Neri,false,"When you meet a person, you get a glimmer of possibilities, a passing combination of gestures, attitudes, glances (…) I’m interested in seeing how the dimension of the world changes when there is a person occupying the space, when there is a person defining it.(Francesco Neri)
Every part of the image is important. The background, too.There is always something behind a character. The background itself can be evocative. It can also be an element of study. Whether a man is photographed leaning almost identically against a fence or a wall, his gaze is elsewhere. Only the camera follows its movement. These photographs were taken with a large-format camera in Porto Tolle, at the very eastern end of the River Po Delta, during a few trips for another commission. Using a camera of this type requires the use of a tripod. You have to stop if you want to avoid greater blur. You have to position yourself to be able to see clearly. This precision of technique is reflected in the calm and carefully composed images.
Francesco Neri (*1982) is Professor of Photography at the Institute for Graphic Design in Faenza and a member of the AA School of Architecture, London. For more than fifteen years he has been working on various long-term photographic projects, especially in the field of portraiture, but landscape and interiors are also among his fields of interest.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hb_fn_Porto_tolle_Mockup_U1_gross.jpg,https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hb_fn_Porto_tolle_Mockup_U1_Klein.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hb_fn_Porto_tolle_Mockup_1.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hb_fn_Porto_tolle_Mockup_3.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hb_fn_Porto_tolle_Mockup_4.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hb_fn_Porto_tolle_Mockup_6.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hb_fn_Porto_tolle_Mockup_7.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hb_fn_Porto_tolle_Mockup_8.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hb_fn_Porto_tolle_Mockup_9.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hb_fn_Porto_tolle_Mockup_U4_Klein.jpg,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/francesco-neri-porto-tolle-en/
Proof of Work,Danny Franzreb,false,"In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper entitled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” in response to the financial crisis. This text was the birth of a new paradigm, the blockchain.
Based on Nakamoto’s vision, people around the world created a new infrastructure that could be used to transfer assets, information, and much more. Since then, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, or applications such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become particularly well-known. But only insiders understand the exact contexts of these abstract terms.
To visually shed light on the cryptic darkness, Danny Franzreb embarked on a year-long journey during the boom phase of cryptocurrencies between 2021-2022 to visit miners, investors, and fortune seekers who were early adopters of the opportunities offered by these digital currencies. The resulting work uses striking imagery to document places and people engaged in the crypto world—from small basement prospectors to industrial mining farms, or from installations, cooling units, cable forests, and industrial ruins in Russia to the first high-tech factories with sustainable production in Sweden. Texts by the authors Holly Roussell (specialist in contemporary art and photography, curator at UCCA, Center for Contemporary Art, China) and Anika Meier (curator and author specializing in digital art and NFTs, Hamburg) complement Danny Franzreb’s images.
Danny Franzreb (*1979) is a photographer and professor of media design & user experience at the Neu-Ulm University of Applied Sciences. His award-winning work explores the transformative effects of modern society.

Flatlands,Henrik Spohler,false,"For his latest project, Henrik Spohler traveled to the Netherlands on five extended trips in 2020/21, totaling 7,500 km. On these journeys he looked at this country in the heart of Western Europe from the perspective of an outsider. Flatlands is a photographic examination of landscape in the very country, where the genre of landscape painting was developed in the seventeenth century. Today, the Netherlands is the most densely populated country in Europe, crisscrossed by a complex network of roads, canals and railroads. Seemingly endless industrial parks along the traffic routes characterize the landscape and indicate economic prosperity. Every square meter of land is used, every cubic meter of water is integrated into a system of dams, locks, and canals. The country, once considered hard-to-inhabit marshland, now symbolizes the radical transformation of the environment by man. Spohler and his images demonstrate how a cultural landscape, marked by complex historical, economic and social references, can be read and represented.
Henrik Spohler (*1965) studied at the Folkwang University of the Arts in Essen and has been working as a freelance photographer since 1992. His award-winning work is part of public and private collections and has been shown both nationally and internationally in numerous solo and group exhibitions. Flatlands is his sixth book.

Carrousel,Volker Hinz,false,"Volker Hinz (1947–2019) was one of the great German photographers of the 20th and early 21st centuries. He himself selected the pictures for the second volume “Carrousel” of the book trilogy (edited by his wife Henriette Väth-Hinz) for an exhibition in 2015. They were taken behind the scenes of countless fashion shows—especially in Paris, where his ticket as a Stern photographer gave him access to areas that remained closed to ordinary photojournalists. The Paris images, taken between the 1970s and 1990s, are complemented by shots from Milan, Florence, London, New York, Beijing, Shanghai, Moscow, and Hamburg. They give us a glimpse behind the scenes of the haute couture scene and scene, while also depicting fashion designers—occasionally in private, completely “unadorned,” but also in their function as major figures on the art scene. From Karl Lagerfeld to Thierry Mugler, from Yves Saint Laurent to Claude Montana and Armani, Hinz observed many of the legendary designers of his time. Staying true to his style, he was not impressed by the glittering world of models and fashion and managed to capture very personal, candid moments.
The design of this book is based on the magazine style of the 1990s as in a slide carousel, the pictures are collaged together allowing the viewer to dive deep into the great era of the fashion world, coutouriers, and supermodels.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hb_vh_caroussel_mockup_U1_Gross.jpg,https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hb_vh_caroussel_U1_klein.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hb_vh_caroussel_mockup_1.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hb_vh_caroussel_mockup_9.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hb_vh_caroussel_mockup_2.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hb_vh_caroussel_mockup_8.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hb_vh_caroussel_mockup_7.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hb_vh_caroussel_mockup_3.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hb_vh_caroussel_mockup_15.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hb_vh_caroussel_mockup_14.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hb_vh_caroussel_mockup_13.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hb_vh_caroussel_U4_klein.jpg,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/volker-hinz-carrousel-en/
Sugar Beets,Ingar Krauss,false,"Ingar Krauss has been depicting sugar beets in their individual form since 2017. As he did in his book 2016 book of still lifes „39 Bilder“ , he also stages the sugar beets in natural light against a dark background, photographing them in black-and-white using analog methods and reducing them to the essentials of their appearance. Thus, over the years, a typology of this „Beta Vulgaris“ has emerged.
His sugar beet physiognomies allow the cultivar to appear in its simple dignity and melancholy, while at the same time providing the opportunity to contemplate human perception of, and appreciation, for nature and its products.
To avoid superficial, quick browsing, this publication was not conceived as a classic book, but as a lavishly produced portfolio box, with 36 individual picture cards printed in strong tritone on cardboard, a poster featuring the complete typology, and a text booklet with an essay by Eugen Blume.
Ingar Krauss (*1965) works exclusively in analog, makes all the prints himself, and understands photography as an “alchemical image process that is also related to fine art, painting, and printmaking, in terms of craftsmanship” (from the accompanying text by Eugen Blume).
Eugen Blume lives and works as a freelance curator and author in Berlin, where he was director of the Hamburger Bahnhof, Museum für Gegenwartskunst until 2016.

Cold Mountain Exclusive Edition,Michael Lange,true,"For six years, Michael Lange (1953 – 2025) made extensive journeys to various regions of the French Alps (Mercantour, Ecrin, Serre-Chevalier, Valloire, Val Cenis, Vanoise and others) searching for solitude and silence. High up in the mountains he created a collection of impressive meditative images, between light and dark, quiet and storm. He followed the idea that there is also and particularly in landscape photography, the decisive moment, the moment of perfect harmony between nature, landscape and the photographer. Often he had to wait for days, sometimes for weeks, high up in the mountains. Constantly accompanied by changes in weather and light, rain and snow showers, sudden beams of sunlight and mountains covered in mist – he was always in search of that moment. The fifty-two images in the book combine the quiet majesty of the mountain landscapes with fleeting moments of the perception of nature. Michael Lange deals with the question of how we perceive what we see and how we can find new ways to express our feelings in pictures. The title COLD MOUNTAIN refers to the legendary Zen monk, poet and recluse Hanshan (“Cold Mountain”) from 7th century China. The selection of poems reflecting the solitude of the mountains and human soul states is taken from four famous Zen hermits – Hanshan, Ikkyu, Basho and Ryokan – from the 7th, 15th, 17th and 18th centuries in China and Japan. In the sequence of the book, the poems connect the groups of pictures. They set the tone and determine the atmosphere of the book and the pictures and reflect the author’s long relationship to Zen Buddhism, which has had a major influence on his landscape photography.
The regular edition of COLD MOUNTAIN is sold out but Michael Lange sent us 30 copies of this edition from his personal collection, in 2024.

Lissabon ’87/88,Ute & Werner Mahler,false,"In 1987 and 1988 photographers Ute Mahler and Werner Mahler, together with author Wolfgang Kil, made two trips to Lisbon to photograph and describe the city and its people for a book, to be published by Leipzig Brockhaus. They were already well-known in the GDR, and it was a rare opportunity for them to have a look at the other side of the Iron Curtain. But the book planned for 1989 could no longer be released and thus shared the fate of many similar books from the time shortly before the fall of the Wall. The pictures and contact sheets disappeared into gray boxes in an archive in Brandenburg and did not resurface until 2021. Upon sifting through the images, it became clear that Lisbon was actually their first joint project, long before the Mahlers consciously decided to co-author their joint projects. Nevertheless, the shared signature they developed in Monalises of the Suburbs, Strange Days, Small Town, and Streams is already visible. The Lisbon pictures are black and white street photographs in the best sense, taken while strolling through the city that was unknown yet certainly fascinating to the small group of travelers from East Berlin, and, some thirty years later, provides its very own historical perspectives. A small book, carefully conceived, designed and laid out by Florian Lamm.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hb_uwm_Lissabon_U1_gr_New.jpg,https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hb_uwm_Lissabon_U1_kl_new.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hb_uwm_Lissabon_Mockup13.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hb_uwm_Lissabon_Mockup5.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hb_uwm_Lissabon_Mockup7.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hb_uwm_Lissabon_Mockup8.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hb_uwm_Lissabon_Mockup10.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hb_uwm_Lissabon_Mockup11.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hb_uwm_Lissabon_Mockup_2.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hb_uwm_Lissabon_Mockup6.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mockup.gif,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/ute-werner-mahler-lissabon-87-88/
mónos,Vincenzo Pagliuca,true,"Only in “mónos” do huts and palaces come so close to meaning the same thing. Vincenzo Pagliuca’s book is an architectural B-movie set in the southern Apennines of Italy. The solitary buildings he photographed are simple houses, composed of elementary geometric shapes. Yet some of the rudimentary dwellings look like pastel, miniature pastiches of historical or even avant-garde buildings. They seem to be out of place, formed from architectural elements that often don’t quite fit together. Always photographed from a central perspective and under an overcast sky, they become sculptures of the common man and make us think about how and why people build, live, and think.
Vincenzo Pagliuca (*1980) studied economics before turning to photography as an autodidact, eventually attending the master class of Antonio Biasiucci‘s “laboratorio irregolare”. His long-term projects focus primarily on the rural and suburban regions of his native country. Pagliuca‘s work has been exhibited and published internationally. “mónos” is his second book. He lives and works in Brescia.

Habitat Berlin-Charlottenburg,Anne Schönharting,false,"In 2012 Anne Schönharting began photographing the residents of Charlottenburg in their natural habitat. For more than ten years she photographed people and their apartments in deeply traditional neighborhood, known as one of Berlin´s “better” districts. Those portrayed must have liked the photographer’s quiet but determined way of working and recommended her to others. In her carefully composed images, we see people and their homes in wondrous situations. Women, men, couples, families, students, children — all in their own unique style. Sometimes we just see the view of an empty room, a window, or a door. They tell us about the people who usually live there but are absent at the moment.  The text by Inka Schube delicately senses these moods and puts them in a literary context. Anne Schönharting shows the people opposite her without prejudice, at a natural distance and at eye level. The appearance of the large-format book designed by Stefan Stefanescu is deliberately reminiscent of book design in Berlin in the 1920s.
Anne Schönharting (*1973) joined the agency OSTKREUZ – Agentur der Fotografen in 1999. Her focus is on portrait – and artistic documentary photography. In addition to her personal long-term projects, she also works on assignment for national and international clients. In 2020, Hartmann Books published her award-winning first book “The Legacy”, an exploration of her family’s colonial past.

Vast Land,Wolfgang Bellwinkel,false,"Between the year 849 and the present, Myanmar has had an astounding 22 capitals, while the seat of government has changed 39 times. Vast Land by Wolfgang Bellwinkel is a photographic study of the country‘s last three capitals: Mandalay (1857–1885), Yangon (1885–2005) and Naypyitaw (since 2005). All of them were planned on the drawing board; all are shaped by the political aspirations and the self-image of those who built them. Using these three cities as case studies, Bellwinkel tells the story of a country where one tragedy follows the next, from colonial oppression to the current state of emergency. World war, civil war, natural disasters, military dictatorship, ethnic conflicts, and displacement have left their marks of the capitals’ cityscapes. In contrast to the drama of rapidly unfolding events, Bellwinkel‘s images are sober and precise photographs that reveal the character and various historical layers of the three cities. In doing so, Bellwinkel undertakes nothing less than an archaeology of Myanmar‘s recent history.
Complementing the photographs, the 20-page essay by sociologist Heinz Schütte offers an in-depth look at the history and present of the featured cities.
Wolfgang Bellwinkel (*1959) completed his degree in photography at the Folkwang University of the Arts in Essen in 1994 with a project on the war in Bosnia. Urbanization, social upheaval, political ­violence – but also his personal position in the world – are the major themes of the projects Bellwinkel realizes and exhibits internationally. Bellwinkel teaches at universities in Germany and Asia, living and working both there and in Berlin.

It’s All One Song,Marco Zanta,false,"“It‘s All One Song” brings together architectural photographs by Italian photographer Marco Zanta taken during his travels through Europe, the USA, Asia, and Africa over the course of the last decades. In a seemingly random sequence, the images jump from continent to continent, from interior to exterior spaces, from era to era, from postmodernism to dilapidated buildings and back again to urban megalomania made out of concrete, steel, and glass. In the constantly changing rhythm of images merging subtly into one another, transnational and transcultural motifs, themes, and urban topographies are revealed on page after page. In this “song” that Zanta invokes, the cities depicted merge into a single stream of consciousness, a global space that ranges from promising utopia to late capitalist nightmare.
Marco Zanta (*1962) is one of Italy‘s best-known architectural photographers. Since the 1980s he has been exploring how urban and industrial space can be depicted photographically. In addition he has also worked for renowned architectural firms such as John Pawson Studio, Afra e Tobia Scarpa, and Tadao Ando. Zanta has participated in several editions of the Venice Biennale. His works have been exhibited in institutions worldwide and are represented in numerous public and private collections.

War of Whispers,John Willheim,false,"“Only the dead have seen the end of war.”
—George Santayana, Soliloquies in England and Later Soliloquies (1922), often wrongly attributed to Plato
This book tells the extraordinary story of what later became known as the “CIA’s Secret War” in the Asian country of Laos in the 1960s and 1970s. It was the largest clandestine CIA operation to this day. A guerrilla army of Hmong people fought against the North Vietnamese communist-supported Pathet Lao. While the war in next-door Vietnam was widely covered by the media, the Secret War was decidedly not. Reporters who came to investigate rumors about a war were turned away at gunpoint—with one exception. A newly minted CIA officer, John Willheim, already an accomplished photographer, was chosen to enter and document the Secret War, without any restrictions. His photographs and films were highly classified at the time. Only top American intelligence officials, a few senior U.S. congressmen, and President Lyndon Johnson had access to Willheim’s material. In the decades to follow, they remained almost entirely hidden. Far from glorifying war, the striking images and informative text in this book can be seen today, fifty years later, as historic testimony of an almost lost era. This is the only photo book ever published on the Secret War. Everyday images of the people, villages, and landscapes behind the battlelines stand in brutal contrast to the reality of war. Willheim’s sympathies were clearly allied with the Hmong people who were fighting this proxy war for the United States against communists in the North and ultimately lost it. At war’s end, those Hmong who did not flee Laos were persecuted and continue to be by the current communist government as “America’s forgotten warriors.” Tens of thousands of Hmong fled to neighboring Thailand and later emigrated to the United States, France, and Germany. Willheim turned over his historic photographs, films, and thoughts to the award-winning Dutch photo book designer -SYB-, who combined them into a riveting, almost cinematic documentary photobook.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wilheim_cover.jpg,https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wilheim_cover_klein.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wilheim_Magazin01.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wilheim_Magazin02.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wilheim_Magazin03.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wilheim_Magazin04.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wilheim_Magazin05.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wilheim_Magazin06.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wilheim_Magazin07.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wilheim_Magazin08.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wilheim_Magazin09.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wilheim_back.jpg,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/john-willheim-war-of-whispers/
Experiment HEIMAT,Experiment HEIMAT,false,"Does Heimat, the German term for »homeland,« refer to an emotion or a place? Is it where we grew up or where we live now? Does it even exist anymore? Is it a utopia worth striving for or an idea to be dismissed? Is it an inescapable destiny or something we create for ourselves? Is there only one Heimat, or are there many versions of it? These are questions posed by the photography and literature project Experiment HEIMAT. Curated by photographer Peter Bialobrzeski and the Westphalian Office for Literature Office, the book presents the visual and literary contributions of renowned authors and photographers who were invited to participate in the project. In 2021 they traveled to nine different sites in Westphalia that embody Heimat for Germans, including the Hermannsdenkmal monument, the Henrichenburg ship hoist in Waltrop, the Henrichshütte smeltery in Hattingen, and Ruhr University in Bochum. In an exchange with locals, club organizations, and tourists, they investigated the meaning those groups ascribe to each place. The main issue was to what extent the outside view overlaps with the self-perception of Westphalians. The result is a highly diverse mix of artistic interpretations that challenge the notion of Heimat and often take it to absurd lengths.

Next Door Auschwitz,die arge lola,false,"Auschwitz is a location that has been illuminated countless times, that has been researched for decades, and that is being visited each year by millions of people. Nevertheless, directly next to the camps there is an almost unknown area, consisting of the everyday homes of people who by historical and biographical chance became neighbours of the locations of terror. Over the course of a number of years, Andreas Langen and Kai Loges went to these areas to document visually and with words.
From this a large repository of images and texts arose a documentary record of locations and people, with precise texts added that explain the context. This book is a reflection of Auschwitz as a historical location and the resulting questions it poses. How can a community exist in the shadows of historical trauma? What is the relationship between individual and collective memory? What types of biography arise from the chance fact of being enveloped in an extreme history of violence? What is the spirit of a place? Lastly, how do we relate to Auschwitz today?
About the photographers
Since 1994, Kai Loges and Andreas Langen have been cooperating under the name “die arge lola”. They investigate topics as diverse as democracy, architecture, or cultural history. Exhibitions include, for example, the German pavilion at the 2016 Venice Architectural Biennale; they have taught at a number of universities and worked as journalists for SWR2, Photonews, and others; they have been board members of Deutsche Fotografische Akademie DFA for many years.

“The city has changed dramatically. It is turning into another Singapore with skywalks, loads of airconditioned malls, and Western-style coffee stalls. It’s easier now to buy a vanilla latte than a pad thai in the streets of the capital of Siam.”
About the City Diaries
The city at the beginning of the twenty-first century is the major theme of Peter Bialobrzeski’s “City Diaries”. In this long-term project, he has been investigating since 2013 whether the preconception of a city — a product of prejudices, personal observations and media communications — can be transformed into a specific image. Whether Osaka or Unna, Wuhan or Wolfsburg, Bialobrzeski is interested in the cultural differences increasingly hidden by globalization, which he makes visible by means of a seemingly objectifying aesthetic. Current political and social developments are also reflected in Bialobrzeski’s images and diary entries. Cairo, for example, cannot be understood without the Arab Spring, Athens without the euro crisis, and Wolfsburg, of course, without VW and the emissions scandal. On the occasion of the publication of “Athens Diary,” Melanie Mühl wrote in the FAZ: “Everyone should see these photographs.”
The format and page count of all titles are identical. This systematic approach allows for a comparative view of different urban settings, ranging from a megalopolis like Bangkok to a Westphalian medium-sized town like Unna. Further volumes will be published in loose order over the next few years.
Peter Bialobrzeski’s work has been exhibited worldwide. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including two World Press Photo Awards (2003, 2010).

Unna Diary,Peter Bialobrzeski,true,"Unna Diary, April 11–April 16, 2021
April 14, 2021
When I start my morning walk at 6:30 I am accompanied from day one by a noisy motorized sweeper. The vanguard dressed in orange with a hoodie underneath is operating a leaf blower. One of his guilty pleasures is to blow a small white plastic bag aimlessly through the pedestrian zone. I can’t help being reminded of the film American Beauty—without the beauty but with a lot of noise. When I ask him about the reasoning for his activity he explains to me in his nice local accent that his job is to stir up the filth, that the sweeper can do the rest.

Sarajevo Diary,Peter Bialobrzeski,true,"Sarajevo Diary, April 10–April 18, 2019
April 18, 2019
“A cable car takes me up a steep hill. The buildings surrounding this unusual transport remind me of South American favelas. It is avant-garde architecture, a mixture of Swiss Brutal- ism of the eighties and playful brick decoration. I immediately like it and catch sight of the huge apartment complex that has been build for the athletes of the 1984 Winter Olympics. Reach Out, that Moroder tune written for the Olympics, starts playing in my head while I suddenly realize that the parking lot I am looking down at is that very one I had seen days ago in a photograph at the Historical Museum. The cars had the typical color of the late 1980s. And were all wrecks, smashed up by grenades and shells.”

George Town Diary,Peter Bialobrzeski,true,"George Town Diary, August 23–August 30, 2018

“On the edge of the historic center, the visitor can imagine what would have happened to old George Town if it hadn’t been declared a world heritage site by UNESCO in 2008. (Just take close look at the photographs!). What did happen to old George Town because of that privilege is a constant influx of tourist with a crave for Western-style cafés, serving cappuccino, cake and bagels. It always feels very odd to me that people fly thousands of airmiles, producing tons of CO2 to end up in a joint, of which they have plenty at home.”

L.A. Crossing,Jens Liebchen,false,"Thousands of kilometers by car and camera through Los Angeles – dream or nightmare? In his long-term project L.A. Crossing, which has been in the making since 2010, Jens Liebchen shows us the capital of unconditional automotive mobility like most of its inhabitants prefer to look at it: through the windows of their cars. Out of the moving car, Liebchen looks at a city that embodies the opposites of utopia and dystopia. L.A. Crossing itself sounds like the title of a movie, accordingly the street becomes a stage and the photography becomes a kind of still image. Bathed in the beguiling Californian light, the city appears fictitious and real at the same time. An icon of photographic art, Stephen Shore’s image »La Brea/Beverly« serves as a theoretical starting point for Liebchen’s work. Beginning with the »La Brea Matrix Project«, which was centered around said photo, Liebchen has reversed the common view and now looks back from the street to the city. Neither does he stop, like Lee Friedlander (in “America by Car”), nor does follow a strict gird like Ed Ruscha (in “Every Building on the Sunset Strip”). Liebchen drives and drives and drives. From the privileged and air-conditioned perspective of the driver’s seat, the City of Angels lights and shadows are revealed.
Jens Liebchen (*1970) has been working as a freelance photographer since his studies of ethnology. His works and have been exhibited worldwide and can be found, among others, in the collection of the DZ BANK Kunstsammlung in Frankfurt a.M. and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Liebchen lives and works in Berlin. He is represented by Springer Gallery.

Realitatea,Andrea Diefenbach,false,"Andrea Diefenbach’s images from the rural regions of the Republic of Moldova are a journey through time to a place that has been in an identity crisis since its independence 30 years ago. This visual survey is already her second book about the country torn between the EU and Russia, stagnation and progress, corruption and the rule of law. Her calm, at times whimsical observations demonstrate great empathy for Moldova and its people’s way of living. In their tranquility, the images adapt to the tempo of Moldovan everyday life, which oscillates between upheaval and stagnation. »Realitatea« not only gathers photographic vignettes from a country in a state of limbo, but also contextualizes them within the political events of the past ten years through facsimiles of Moldovan newspapers and analytical texts.
Andrea Diefenbach (*1974) works for magazines and organizations in Germany and internationally. She has been teaching photography at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts since 2016. »Realitatea« is her third book. Diefenbach’s work has been shown at the Hamburger Kunsthalle, the Folkwang Museum Essen, the Reiss Engelhorn Museum Mannheim, and the Munich Stadtmuseum, among others. In 2024 she was granted the Dr. Erich Salomon Award by the German Photographic Society (DGPh). More information here.

Deep Time,Marion Kalter,false,"Marion Kalter’s photographs are always about people. This was one of her focuses when she was a young journalist who encountered avant-garde artists and intellectuals of the 1970s such as Anaïs Nin, Paul Bowles, William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Susan Sontag, and Meret Oppenheim. She also met photographers such as Mary Ellen Mark and Garry Winogrand at early editions of the photography festival Rencontres d’Arles and in Paris. In Deep Time, her first monograph, Kalter relates her story in images, taking inventory of an era and its lifestyle through a series of different photographic techniques and subjects. She combines classic portraits with radical staged self-portraits and juxtaposes still lifes of objects from her parent’s estate with collages of historical photographs and contemporary shots taken with a smartphone. These various temporal and geographical levels create an impressive pictorial cosmos in which the only constants are the intensity and subjectivity with which Kalter attempts to understand her past.
Marion Kalter (*1951 in Salzburg) studied painting and art history in the United States and Paris before she began to work with photography. In addition to her own artistic work, she worked as a journalist and translator, which presented her with numerous opportunities to take portraits of personalities from the art world. Her images and texts have been published in magazines and newspapers such as European Photography, Die ZEIT, and Le Monde. She lives and works in Paris and Chabenet, France.

"My Mother, My Sister, and I",Christa Mayer,false,"»My Mother, My Sister, and I« is a family study in photographs that focuses on the photographer’s relationship with her mother, bordering on a systemic family constellation. In her first book, Christa Mayer combines photographs of her mother and sister, self-portraits, still lifes, landscape photographs, and video portraits to create a narrative that reveals a microcosm visualizing different aspects of attachment, relationship, and family. Mayer’s approach is unsparing yet full of affection. Her photography is direct in nature, and her empathy with her photographic subjects is balanced with Mayer’s analytical interest in them. This ambivalence runs through all the portrait series in the book. Proximity and distance, strangeness and familiarity, resistance and acceptance resonate throughout the work. This tension not only tells a story of complex family dynamics, but also symbolically addresses themes such as aging, generational conflict, and family structures.
Christa Mayer (*1945) was one of the few women to assert herself within the legendary »Werkstatt für Photographie« founded by Michael Schmidt in Kreuzberg, Berlin. Mayer became known for her photographs of the locked psychiatric ward where she worked for decades as a psychotherapist. The appraisal of her life’s work, which also includes landscape photographs, staged images, and abstract compositions, has only just begun.

Under Water,Hans-Christian Schink,false,"»Unter Wasser« is both a radical break and a consistent continuation of Hans-Christian Schink’s previous work. Known for his precisely composed large-format photographs, his new body of work constitutes a radical change in his photographic method because he accepts chance as a factor in the image making process. The photos were made in different biotopes of Germany’s most water-rich state, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: lakes, ditches, and so-called kettles. These bodies of water were mostly created when the ice sheet receded at the end of the last ice age and thus mark the beginning of the very civilization that Schink dissects in his photography. Schink worked with an underwater camera, yet he did not dive. Thus he could merely guess what was visible through the viewfinder. In a very confined space, he reveals unknown and almost archaic landscapes. His pictures distort the actual proportions, creating a mysterious miniature world with sculptural character. The subject of »Unter Wasser« is also bigger than the small biotopes initially suggest: the relationship between man and nature. The worlds under water cannot be separated from those above ground since they are also shaped by agriculture and climate change. Schink thus reconnects with one of the major themes in his work, namely that of socially determined topographies.
Hans-Christian Schink (*1961) studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Leipzig. His landscape and architectural photography, probing the relationship between nature and civilization, have gathered much critical acclaim. He is considered one of the most important contemporary German photographers. Schink lives and works in Plath, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

Macht Liebe,Anne Morgenstern,false,"What can a body be and what is it allowed to be? The bodies in Anne Morgenstern’s pictures undermine any categorization. Sometimes they are sensual, sometimes brutal. At times they are alive, at times they turn into objects. They are bodies that are in control and controlled by others. They are always irritating. Like the photographer’s gaze, which is as unsparing as it is tender, they take on different characteristics and roles. In an interplay of form, color, and materiality, Morgenstern combines photographs of human bodies with those of objects. In doing so, she relates them to one another and gives them new meaning. Bodies as we think we know them are deconstructed and embedded in new contexts. This raises questions of gender and identity that demand a second look. Morgenstern not only demonstrates great sensibility in her images, but also demands the same quality from us. »Macht Liebe« is a highly political book, an appeal to allow ambivalences and to see each other anew.
Anne Morgenstern (*1976 in Leipzig) studied photography in Munich and Zurich, where she lives and works. Her work has been exhibited at ICP New York, Fotomuseum Winterthur, and FOTODOKS Munich. In 2016 she received the German Photo Book Award for her first book “Land ohne Mitte”. An extensive selection of her project “Reinheit”, published as a book in 2017, is in the collection of the Fotostiftung Schweiz. Morgenstern works as a portrait and reportage photographer, among other publications for ZEIT Magazin, Das Magazin and Vogue Germany.

Fairies,Kathrin Linkersdorff,false,"Kathrin Linkersdorff’s deeply poetic images are inspired by the Japanese philosophy of wabi sabi, which focuses on the beauty of the imperfect and fleeting. Presented here comprehensively for the first time, the pictures from the series Fairies capture fading moments of transience with the lightest possible touch. Caught between the impression of old masters’ still life or vanitas paintings and cool, dissecting abstraction, they build a mysterious fascination.
Photographer Kathrin Linkersdorff (*1966 in Berlin) is one of the most promising recent discoveries in Germany. She started her career as an architect. A job related multi-year stay in Japan provided important influence for her work. »With their captivating clarity, her works are reminiscent of Karl Blossfeldt’s photographs of plants. Their aesthetics refers to photographs by Edward Weston.« wrote Barbara Esch-Marowski (in a text for the first exhibition of the images,“Draussenstadt”, presented in public spaces in Berlin in the fall of 2020).
“I am interested in the impermanence of flowers as a metaphor for the cycle of life. My photographic portraits fathom every living organism’s essence and hidden structures.” (Kathrin Linkersdorff)

Cityscapes 1979–1985,Ulrich Wüst,false,"Ulrich Wüst became known to an international audience as an important documentary art photographer when he participated in documenta 14 in 2017. He has been documenting the status and development of East German cities since the 1970s. His black-and-white photographs strike a careful balance between presumed objectivity and subtle irony, and they comment on the transformation of cities and the lack of a societal vision in the GDR. “Stadtbilder”, photographed by Wüst from 1979 to 1985, is considered as his most important body of work from that period. For the first time, they are now being presented in a comprehensible fashion with added commentary in this book. The approximately 100 plates include the full set of 50 photographs from “Stadtbilder” plus 50 additional pictures that Wüst only recently printed from original negatives.
Ulrich Wüst (*1949) studied at the university for architecture and civil engineering in Weimar. Up until 1977, he first worked as a city planner and then as a picture editor. Since 1983, he has been working as a freelance photographer. In the middle of the 1980s, he was considered to be one of the most important photographers in the GDR. He lives and works in Berlin and Mecklenburg.

Verso Nord,"Guido Guidi, Gerry Johansson",false,"In 2019, Guido Guidi and Gerry Johansson – two of the great masters of analog photography in the 20/21st century– took part in the „Verso Nord“ photography campaign, which was organized as part of the P=S+N project in Castelfranco, Veneto and the surrounding area. While Guidi focussed his attention on the historic centre of this small town, concentrating on architectural material in order to capture in detail, the layers of history and time, Johansson moved around the area of urban spread, assessing through photography the cultural imagination of northeastern Italy, where architecture and nature, residential buildings and space become special witnesses of a casual landscape, one with uncertain, mysterious features. Guido Guidi, by shifting his point of view – obtained through the use of a large format (8×10”) camera – identifies a tool for verifying reality, raising new questions about photography and its inherent codes. Gerry Johansson e×tracts the substance of the places he encounters through traditional black-and-white photography. He aims at recomposing the fragments of a public imagination composed of micro-landscapes, poised ambiguously between estrangement and objectivity.
In terms of editing, design, colour separation, choice of materials, printing and bookbinding we think this book is a graphic „Gesamtkunstwerk made in Veneto, Italy”. It was created in close cooperation with the photographers, the designer, the editors and one of the many outstanding local graphic companies not far from Castelfranco (Grafiche Antiga).

Chalets of Switzerland,Patrick Lambertz,false,"The chalet, a luxurious and romantic remote mountain hut that exists in “splendid isolation” in a sunny winter landscape — this is one of the most popular cliché images of Switzerland. However, the actual meaning of the term “chalet”, derived from the Latin word cala: “protected place”, is simply that of an Alpine dairy hut oder shelter. On his many trips through his adopted home, Patrick Lambertz has run into many houses that do not conform to the chliché of the Swiss chalet. They are old houses that barely managed to escape the building and renovation boom that has plagued the country for decades. By photographing them in front of a wintery backdrop he abstracts these houses from their context, heightens their individual character, and provides them with an aura of poetry and irony. Following the tradition of Karl Blossfeldt and Bernd and Hilla Becher, Lambertz creates a typological canon of forgotten, yet memorable Swiss houses. Nature itself provides the photo studio: cloudy skies and dense fog provide soft light with little contrast. Snow covered mountains and hills deliver the neutral backdrop. SYB, the legendary photobook designer from The Hague and master of the “Dutch altar fold”, developed a congenial minimalist concept for the book of Patrick Lambertz’s photographs from the Swiss mountains. The houses are made to steadily appear and disappear from the wintery paper white.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hb_pl_chalets_mockup_U1_gross_neu.jpg,https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hb_pl_chalets_mockup_U1_klein_neu.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hb_pl_chalets_mockup_innenteil_01.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hb_pl_chalets_mockup_innenteil_02.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hb_pl_chalets_mockup_innenteil_03.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hb_pl_chalets_mockup_innenteil_04.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hb_pl_chalets_mockup_innenteil_05.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hb_pl_chalets_mockup_innenteil_06.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hb_pl_chalets_mockup_innenteil_07.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hb_pl_chalets_mockup_innenteil_08.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hb_pl_chalets_mockup_U4_neu.jpg,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/patrick-lambertz-chalets-of-switzerland-en/
The Capital,Günter Steffen,false,"East Berlin in the Eighties
Following the spirit of French director Robert Bresson’s maxim “Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen” between 1984 and 1989 photographer Günter Steffen produced an impressive cycle of work dealing with East Berlin’s Mitte district where he lived and worked. Predominantly in the early morning hours he traversed seemingly untouched and empty streets, squares, backyards, ruins, and locations along the monstrous Berlin Wall. He captured ghostly sceneries with his 35mm camera in grainy and contrasty black-and-white photographs. For him, the resulting images are testimonies of predominant feelings at the time. Helplessness, inner strife, and anger resulted in an end-times mood, which frequently was caused by the loss of friends who had left for the West. The feelings of doom in Steffen’s photographs are contrasted with selected text fragments from the dystopian Soviet novel WE, written by Yevgeny Zamyatin (*1884 Lebedyan, † 1937 Paris) in 1920. This politically explosive precursor to other famous dystopian novels is a nightmarish description of a totalitarian surveillance state. First published abroad by exiles in 1924, the novel had been banned throughout the Eastern Bloc and was allowed to be released in the Soviet Union only in 1988 under the reign of Mikhail Gorbachev.
Günter Steffen was born in Berlin in 1941. He studied physics at Berlin’s Humboldt University. Following his diploma in 1967 he worked as a research assistant. In 1976, Steffen started work as a freelance photographer with a focus on documentary and street photography. He traveled extensively across regions of the former Soviet Union (Central Asia, Caucasus, Aral Sea). Besides realising a number of book projects he also worked on advertising commissions. Today, he lives in Templin (Uckermark). The publication is realized with financial support by Berlin’s Hauptstadtkulturfond.

Los(t) Angeles,Michael Dressel,false,"These days, hardly any photographer dares to take pictures in the streets of Europe in the tradition of classic street photography without consulting with a lawyer. Time and again, however, Michael Dressel still does it. In his adopted home town of Los Angeles he looks at what most of us choose to ignore. He uses his camera to take aim at people in the streets of Los Angeles. They know that they are being photographed. Each portrait and each scene reveals much about their fate and about the city they live in. But the photographs also say something about the photographer himself who documents his city’s inhabitants with an unforgiving, yet empathetic gaze. The pictures’ harsh black and white tones reflect the true reality of Los Angeles, where everyone dreams of making it big, yet only very few succeed. For most of the people in Dressel’s photographs making it big remains an elusive dream.
Born in East Berlin in 1958, Michael Dressel briefly studied set design at the art academy Weissensee. He spent two formative years in East German prisons following a failed escape attempt. After being deported to the West, he briefly lived in West Berlin in 1985 before moving to Los Angeles, where he has been living ever since. There, he works as a sound editor, which among other things resulted in membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. While it is his profession to listen with an attentive ear, looking carefully is his true passion. For many years, he has been roaming the streets of Los Angeles with his cameras, always on the look out for “significant moments.” For the first time, Los(t) Angeles shows a selection of photographs that originated in numerous treks through the streets of Los Angeles from 2014 to 2020.

It remains an ongoing task to uphold this sworn allegiance to uphold the Constitution and to check to what extent citizens can rely on the legal framework established that way. The free press and the arts serve as the fourth estate that helps to accomplish this task.
But what exactly is “the state”? A possible answer would be to say that it’s the citizens. Another one would be to point to public servants. If one takes “the state” as a form of organization it turns into a theoretical construct. In democracies, the separation of powers forms one of their central tenets. Legislative, executive, and judicial branches are strictly separated. They have to act independently from each other. That way, they ensure a balanced power structure, in which the three branches hold each other in check. How can one make a picture of this abstract democratic concept? Is there a way to visualize the separation of powers? Jörg Gläscher’s long-term project “The Oath” demonstrates in an impressive fashion that photography is capable of doing just that.
His photographs of and about mayors, judges, police officers, and citizens provides a reality check of the state of this world’s democracies that are finding themselves under increasing pressure.
It is this set of issues that is being made the topic in “The Oath”, Jörg Gläscher’s comprehensive visual investigation from eleven countries on four continents. The work demonstrates that good photography is able to depict complex political issues in impressive images.

"Papa, Gerd und der Nordmann",Espen Eichhöfer,false,"Papa, Gerd und der Nordmann is the first photobook by Espen Eichhöfer (*1966), a member of Ostkreuz agency. The photographs were made between 2009 and 2019 and deal with the central question of his origin. Where do I come from? What’s my home? Eichhöfer was born in Eastern Norway to a Norwegian mother and a German father. He spent his childhood and adolescence in the Ruhr region. Today, he lives and works in Berlin.
The photographs originated in his Norwegian “home”, which he knows from numerous trips, first as a child and later with his own family. The protagonists are his own relatives, friends, and acquaintances. The background of his photographs is provided by the dark winter months, the endless bright light of summer, and the houses and wide landscape in Eastern Norway. This all combines in partly documentary, partly surreal, partly romantic moods that interpret the Norwegian and German parts of his lineage. Beyond the very personal questions, the book also intends to ask questions about home, identity, line of descent, and national pride, which currently are hotly debated in the German and European political sphere.

1986 – Back to the Present,Michael Kerstgens,false,"In 1986, the decade was halfway over. In April, the reactor in Chernobyl melted down, the Cold War was coming to an end, Helmut Kohl was chancellor, AIDS was just being perceived as a pandemic threat in Germany, and the affluent society of the Federal Republic of Germany was beginning to view consumption as a leisure activity. That year, Michael Kerstgens, then a student at the Gesamthochschule Essen (formerly the Folkwangschule), received a scholarship with the assignment to take a photographic look at the subject of leisure. He used it to observe West Germans engaging in their favorite leisure activities, including sports, fitness, soccer, partying, outdoor swimming, tennis, playing golf (and miniature golf), driving Golfs (and Opels), and shopping. In his essay, Klaus Honnef describes the 1980s as the favorite decade of the West Germans. Compared to their compatriots in the German Democratic Republic, they were doing extremely well. While the GDR past has been the focus of many recent publications, this laconic documentary looks at the other side, precisely observing a relatively carefree West German society. The sweeping changes at the end of the decade were inconceivable—the here and now was more important and more entertaining! For those who lived through the ’80s in the FRG, the pictures of Michael Kerstgens are a (terribly-beautiful) trip down memory lane, for all others a mandatory visual tutorial!
About the Photographer
Michael Kerstgens (*1960), winner of several awards, has been working with photography since his student days in the 1980s. 1986 is his sixth book. Since 2007 he has been a professor at the University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt.

Ich denke auch Familienbilder,Linn Schröder,false,"The photographs in “Ich denke auch Familienbilder” (I Think Family Pictures Too) deal on various levels with one of the most basic tasks of photography, which is to capture and record memories. Family pictures are photographs that help us remember and often even create memories. They can be images of our own, which only arise in our heads or through stories and our own imagination. Linn Schröder combines these two thoughts in a poetic way and creates pictorial worlds that in their surreal, magical, and often staged imagery tell of astonishment, uncertainty, and perhaps even unease.
Schröder traveled to Poland with her twin daughters and followed the footsteps of her mother-in-law, who had escaped to Germany as a young girl during World War II and passed down her experience in stories. This creates a connection between three generations: the grandmother, the mother and the daughters. She also photographed a befriended family with twins at regular intervals and the boy next door, whom she encounters again and again. Schröder often works in black and white, which gives the images an air of universal validity. Seemingly identical nature shots that repeatedly interrupt the narrative flow reinforce this timelessness. At the same time Linn Schröder’s work points far beyond personal experience. Associative images emerge that tell stories in themselves and tell us something about our humanity. In this artist’s book, these worlds of thought are given an intense, mysteriously dreamlike, and grandiose poetic stage.
Linn Schröder, born in 1977, has been a member of Ostkreuz-Agentur der Fotografen since 2004 and a professor of photography at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamburg since 2016. “Ich denke auch Familienbilder” is her first book.

Immergrün,Loredana Nemes,false,"For her new work “Immergrün” (Evergreen), Loredana Nemes created portraits of longtime couples who had responded to a call for lovers in a local newspaper. She combines her quiet, mysteriously abstract black-and-white portraits with shots of evergreen plants and adds another layer to these images with poems.
Old people, often called seniors, are not considered an ideal of beauty in our culture, and it is considered a taboo to show old age in art and media. The couples Loredana Nemes has spoken to and photographed are women and men whose love and intimacy she addresses in these photographs. “Immergrün” makes reference to her work “Blütezeit” (Blossom Time) from 2012, in which—also initiated and supported by the Ludwigsburg Museum—she portrayed young people on the threshold of adulthood. In both series, she experiments with the possibilities and limits of photography. In “Immergrün” she visualizes in analog double exposures the connection of two lovers as well as our inevitable fading away. Her poetic images and poems are a tribute to age and love as well as a celebration of human encounters in times of imposed distance. The result is a sensitive artist’s book whose choice of materials and narrative flow creates a multilayered whole. Loredana Nemes lives and works in Berlin.

"Gaudí, Impresiones Íntimas",Aitor Ortiz,false,"This book is a poem: a poem to the art of printing photographs on paper and binding the sheets into a book and, of course, a poem to Gaudí, the great Catalan architect. Although poems are difficult to describe, we will try anyhow. Aitor Ortiz created this book against all odds, over several years, with the obsession and dedication of a real artist and with the help of several kindred spirits. You have to see it, feel it, smell it, and read it, page by page. The book is the result of an attempt to create a visual medium that corresponds with the artistic genius of Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926). Ortiz combined his expertise as a photographer and artist with the geat talents and skills of like minded people: a poet, a graphic designer, colour separators, printers and binders. The result is a literally biblical, impressively minimalistic publication that is precisely conceived and implemented in every detail. The book presents all 126 pictures of his Gaudí project, which he completed in 2018. The original artworks, that are printed on aluminum plates, are reproduced here in perfectly balanced gray tones. The transparency of the thin paper and blank pages are an integral part of the design concept. The poems and texts by Basque filmmaker and writer Oskar Alegria add an associative level. The pictures were taken at Casa Milà, Sagrada Familia (and its model workshop), Casa Batlló, Park Güell, Torre Bellesguard, Palau Güell, Casa Vicens, Casa Calvet, the Güell Pavilions, and the crypt of the Colònia Güell.
Aitor Ortiz (*1971, Bilbao) is one of the most famous contemporary Spanish photographic artists. His work has been included in numerous solo and group exhibitions in European, Asian, and North American museums. He is represented by Galerie Springer Berlin.

Dark Whispers,Beatrice Minda,false,"Beatrice Minda examines private interiors in the context of historical events in her work. In Myanmar, which was isolated for decades by a rigid military dictatorship, she photographed houses and living spaces in both cities and remote regions. She captured the traces of the inhabitants’ lives and the signs of change. In Dark Whispers the ambivalent aspects of the British colonial period and its consequences are reflected and illuminated by short texts on the history of the houses as well as historical photographs. Minda’s photographs focus on the atmospheres of past lives and the forms of representation with which the inhabitants once sought to fulfill themselves. Often they are objects that have remained untouched for decades and bear witness to the cosmos of a vanished world. But there are also large gaps between then and now. An uncanny emptiness animates these spaces. Dark whispers echo through them—a memento mori to the many unspoken words of Burmese history.
Beatrice Minda lives and works in Berlin. Since 2003 she has participated in exhibitions in Germany and abroad and published books. In her work, include Interior World (2003–07), a series about her parents’ country of origin, Romania, and Iran: Interrupted (2010–13), the private interior is the starting point for her interpretation of the interior as a mirror of society and private and collective history. She has been working on her current project Dark Whispers since 2014.

NOWHERE,Frank van der Salm,false,"NOWHERE shows a world in which Instagrammability is first and foremost, in which the new reality is dictated by the seductive image that may (later) be made from it. Architecture, design, and urban landscape are directed by the mechanisms of global big business, and the same antiseptic beauty exists all over the world. NOWHERE—Imagining the Global City presents the work of Dutch photographer Frank van der Salm from the past twenty-five years. Designed by Irma Boom, the book shows a consumer-oriented, imaginary metropolis. Images, sometimes deliberately upside down, challenge the reality they represent. Seen together they form the image of a city that suddenly seems to be simultaneously everywhere and nowhere: both here and now and nowhere. The essays by Shumon Basar, Aaron Betsky, and Urs Stahel link Frank van der Salm’s oeuvre to the world of design, architecture, urban development, art, and photography.
About the photographer
Frank van der Salm, who was born in Delft in 1964, studied at the Willem de Kooning Academie in Rotterdam. He travels all over the world to find his subjects. Rapidly growing metropolises in areas like southeastern Asia and the Gulf region are among his favorites. Occasionally Van der Salm collaborates with architectural firms such as OMA/Rem Koolhaas, Herzog & de Meuron, and MVRDV.
“During the paused time of the pandemic, Frank van der Salm’s images feel different. They take on the quality of prophetic realism. . . . His urban vistas, his bucolic landscapes, and his portraits of super modernity are mostly empty of human presence.” —Shumon Basar
“He is in no way an ‘architecture photographer’ in the classic sense. . . . Rather, he turns the thinking around and uses architecture to generate photographic images; he makes ‘photography with architecture’ . . . . He uses, to put it another way, architecture for his pictures.” —Urs Stahel
“These are photographs of something and art about something. They do not present this reality as being so alien, either in a surreal or a flat sense, that it is completely other or somewhere else. It is our here now and, if it is not your here and now, Van der Salm shows us, it will be soon.” —Aaron Betsky

"Streets, Fashion, Nudes, Still Lifes",Barbara Probst,false,"Each series of images and tableaux in Barbara Probst’s “Exposures” consist of up to fourteen individual images that capture the same moment from multiple perspectives. This enables the viewer to grasp the same moment from different perspectives without having to move—a visual paradox, so to speak. This book presents her latest, mostly unpublished works from areas that actually belong to classic genres of photography rather than to conceptual photography: street photography, fashion, nudes and still lifes. Particularly the commissioned fashion photographs have received great acclaim in international fashion magazines. The book is published in conjunction with a major solo exhibition at the Kunsthalle Nürnberg, Nuremberg.

Hello. Again.,Volker Hinz,false,"Volker Hinz (1947–2019) is one of Germany’s great photographers and photojournalists. After starting out at Sven Simon’s agency in Bonn, he switched to the magazine stern in 1974, for which he produced legendary photo and travel reports, portraits of artists, politicians, and celebrities in the following decades. Never seen without a camera, he left his mark with his pictures—not only on colleagues, friends, and the many people he portrayed, but also in German photojournalism, whose “golden decades” between the 1970s and the 1990s he helped shape. His images became part of our shared visual memory. This project, coinitiated by Hinz himself, offers a comprehensive overview of his work beyond his well-known pictures, series, and themes, thus proving what a precise judge of character and an astute observer he was. Alongside politicians such as Willy Brandt, Helmut Schmidt, and Angela Merkel; athletes such as Franz Beckenbauer, Pelé, and Muhammad Ali; musicians such as Annie Lennox, Madonna, and Marianne Faithful; artists such as Marina Abramović, Keith Haring, and Cindy Sherman; writers such as William S. Burroughs and Günter Grass; and celebrities such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Karl Lagerfeld, his photographs from the legendary New York nightclub AREA are included in this extensive illustrated book, as well as small everyday impressions and still lifes taken on his travels. In Hinz’s own words: “The photographer must not be a bore. There are enough boring pictures already.”

High up in the mountains he created a collection of impressive meditative images, between light and dark, quiet and storm. He followed the idea that there is also and particularly in landscape photography, the decisive moment, the moment of perfect harmony between nature, landscape and the photographer. Often he had to wait for days, sometimes for weeks, high up in the mountains. Constantly accompanied by changes in weather and light, rain and snow showers, sudden beams of sunlight and mountains covered in mist – he was always in search of that moment. The fifty-two images in the book combine the quiet majesty of the mountain landscapes with fleeting moments of the perception of nature. Michael Lange deals with the question of how we perceive what we see and how we can find new ways to express our feelings in pictures. The title COLD MOUNTAIN refers to the legendary Zen monk, poet and recluse Hanshan (“Cold Mountain”) from 7th century China. The selection of poems reflecting the solitude of the mountains and human soul states is taken from four famous Zen hermits – Hanshan, Ikkyu, Basho and Ryokan – from the 7th, 15th, 17th and 18th centuries in China and Japan. In the sequence of the book, the poems connect the groups of pictures. They set the tone and determine the atmosphere of the book and the pictures and reflect the author’s long relationship to Zen Buddhism, which has had a major influence on his landscape photography.
About the Photographer
Cold Mountain is the fourth publication by the Hamburg-based photo artist Michael Lange, who has been nationally and internationally renowned and has received numerous awards for his previous work, books and exhibitions: “Forest”, “River”, and “LA Drive-By”. Michael Lange died in January 2025. He left his archive and estate to the Stiftung F.C. Gundlach in Hamburg…. there are still two bookprojects to be realized from the archive: “Pond” and “Marine Layer”.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ColdMountain_Cover_01_Shop_neu.jpg,https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ColdMountain_Durchschau_01_Shop_neu.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ColdMountain_Durchschau_02_Shop.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ColdMountain_Durchschau_03_Shop.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ColdMountain_Durchschau_04_Shop.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ColdMountain_Durchschau_05_Shop.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ColdMountain_Durchschau_06_Shop.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ColdMountain_Durchschau_07_Shop.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ColdMountain_Durchschau_08_Shop_neu.jpg,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/michael-lange-cold-mountain-en/
Its Flower Is Hard To Find,Vincent Kohlbecher,false,"Over a period of four years Vincent Kohlbecher visited Poland numerous times. He found motifs that took him back to his childhood, to the Catholic faith, to German history, in Gdańsk, Warsaw, Kraków, Płaszów, Majdanek, and Auschwitz. Kohlbecher’s pictures are texts that beg to be read carefully. The places he describes in his pictures are only accessible to the viewer through the interplay of what he has seen, what is associated with it, and historical memory. The photographer, who always remains at a distance and never becomes part of the narrative, succeeds in taking a rare analytical and sharply focused look at Germany’s neighboring country that remains unknown to most Germans.
About the Photographer 
Vincent Kohlbecher (*1960, Hamburg) was a photojournalist working for German and international magazines in the 1990s and has taught photography at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (HAW) since 2003. “Its Flower Is Hard to Find” is his first book publication.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kohlbecher_Cover_Shop-2.jpg,https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kohlbecher_Durchschau_Shop_01-1.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kohlbecher_Durchschau_Shop_02.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kohlbecher_Durchschau_Shop_03.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kohlbecher_Durchschau_Shop_04.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kohlbecher_Durchschau_Shop_05.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kohlbecher_Durchschau_Shop_06.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kohlbecher_Durchschau_Shop_07.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kohlbecher_Durchschau_Shop_08-1.jpg,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/vincent-kohlbecher-its-flower-is-hard-to-find-en/
The Legacy,Anne Schönharting,false,"What other families call the guest room, was known as the “Africa Room” in Anne Schönharting’s family. Until recently it was located in one half of a semidetached house in Diera near Meissen, where it had been moved after German unification. The “Afrika Room” was where the collection of her great-grandfather Willy Klare was kept for four generations. From 1907 to 1914 Klare worked for a Liverpool-based trader as a cacao plantation manager in what is now Equatorial Guinea. There he collected many objects, including weapons, everyday objects, animal preparations, and jewelry. In addition, the collection contains hundreds of photographs as well as letters and postcards from this period. For four generations the family kept this collection, continually rearranging it in their living space and adding their own travel souvenirs to it.  During the GDR era, the room brought a sense of identity; it symbolized distance and broad expanses, the freedom to travel. Africa was considered a desirable destination;  the colonial background and the provenance of the artifacts remained largely unconsidered. After her parents’ death, the photographer was confronted with this legacy – and now places it in changed contexts in her work and this book. With her own pictures and reproductions of the inherited artifacts and photographs, Anne Schönharting embarks on an associative journey into a history unknown to her and consciously enters into a personal dialogue with her family’s past, with German and European history, and with her own private and social colonial responsibility.
About the Photographer

Daughters of Magic,Johanna-Maria Fritz,false,"Mihaela Minca is the most powerful witch of Romania.  The profession has a tradition in Mihaela’s family, her mother and grandmother were witches already. Today she runs a flourishing international business together with her daughters and her daughter-in-law: From love spells to curses the witches have everything on offer, they receive inquiries from all over the world via the Internet. Nevertheless, magic and predicting the future is not only the profession of these women. They are not a mere business, not a staging. Here, in this Roma family and their closely knit community in Southeastern Europe, magic and mysticism are a natural part of life. The witches’ craft is also an expression of female strength within an everyday culture shaped by men. For “Daughters of Magic” Johanna-Maria Fritz accompanied Mihaela Minca and her family for a year and a half and captured the lives of these modern witches in sensitive, yet powerful images.

Autobahn,Jörg Brüggemann,true,"The Autobahn is an asphalt carpet thirteen thousand kilometers in length that covers all of Germany, both interfering with the landscape and interconnecting the country. Jörg Brüggemann photographed it for five years, from 2014 to 2019. While mobility concepts are constantly changing and being discussed, the Autobahn has remained the same in its form—but for how much longer? Brüggemann’s pictures might soon be seen as historical documents. The highway is probably Germany’s most monumental built structure and an integral part of its cultural identity and history. Designed and in its first segments constructed in the 1920s already (before the Nazis), it was given a musical tribute by Kraftwerk in 1974. The Autobahn stands for the unconditional belief in the future of the postwar period, German engineering, driving without speed limits, but also for traffic jams, lineups of trucks, and multivehicle accidents. Brüggemann shares his fascination and doubts through his pictures. They pose questions about the present and future of mobility. How appropriate and sustainable is this gigantic infrastructure today, where unlimited growth and individual freedom on the one hand and ecology and public interest on the other hand meet in visible contradiction every day?
Jörg Brüggemann is a photographer, lecturer, and curator from Berlin. He has been a member of the OSTKREUZ agency since 2009, and has also worked there as managing director and lecturer since 2019. He works for magazines including ZEIT Magazin, GEO, Monocle, and others and has been awarded numerous prizes and scholarships in the past.

Divided We Stand,Mathias Braschler & Monika Fischer,false,"When Donald Trump was elected to be the forty-fifth president of the United States in 2016, Swiss photographers Monika Fischer and Mathias Braschler were in New York. The results of the election showed a deep divide running through the US and its society—a widening gap dividing the progressive and conservative forces, the urban and the rural, the “red” center of the country and the “blue” coasts. In his first term President Trump did not help to bridge this gap. With his personal style and racist-inflammatory political campaigns, the situation has worsened, especially during the Covid–19 pandemic and the riots of May/June 2020 following the murder of George Floyd. But Trump’s election was only a consequence of this divide. Monika Fischer and Mathias Braschler decided to go on a field-research trip through the US in order to meet the people, from all parts of the country and all parts of society. In April 2019 they started a road trip with a van converted to a practical motorhome including a pop up photo-studio. After leaving New York City they drove 15.000 miles across the nation and visited 40 States. On this self-assigned project they met, interviewed, filmed, and portrayed Americans with a wide variety of backgrounds and very different opinions about life, politics, and their nation. From farmers, factory workers, service people, and investment bankers to politicians and students, all ages, races, professions, and genders are included in this great photographic project capturing a nation that currently finds itself approaching a crucial junction and needs to decide which road to take. DIVIDED WE STAND is the result of this extensive and intensive journey. It combines eighty-two portraits of citizens of the United States and their honest opinions and views about their world. Braschler and Fischer were inspired by famous photographers and their roadtrip-projects, but they created their very own contemporary approach and style for their portraits of the people of the United States.
About the photographers
Mathias Braschler & Monika Fischer live and work in Switzerland and New York. Their collaboration started in 2003 with a first project „About Americans“. They specialize in documenting people from all backgrounds and cultures. Major projects were “China”, “The Human Face of Climate Change”, “Act Now!”, „Faces of Football“. They won numerous awards, including a World Press Photo Award. Their work has appeared in major international magazines, was published in numerous monographs and and has been exhibited in galleries and museums in Europe, Asia, and the United States.

Übermorgen Schnee,Sonja Trabandt,false,"A story about cancer, depression and friendship
Every year around five hundred thousand people in Germany contract cancer. Almost half of the people who fall ill eventually die of it, and despite all medical progress the diagnosis is still extremely traumatic for anyone. In Tomorrow Snow photographer Sonja Trabandt accompanies her friend A.’s battle with cancer. She approaches the illness in a sensitive and documentary visual narrative style as she follows her friend from the initial diagnosis through all phases of the disease and the associated emotions.
The story can be read on several levels, ranging from the fear of treatment, existential worries, and budding hope to the decisive moment of hair loss and femininity. A.’s coping with everyday life is juxtaposed with feelings such as fear, euphoria, sadness, and the depression following treatments. The photographic perspectives range from analytically staged images to emotional descriptions of the state of mind. Trabandt’s pictures enable the viewer to become familiar with the topic of cancer beyond the moments of shock and fear and to deal with the disease in a meaningful way.

Berlin 1945–2000 A Photographic Subject,Berlin 1945–2000 A Photographic Subject,false,"Berlin, 1945–2000 A Photographic Subject explores how German and international photographers alike photographed Berlin between the immediate postwar years and the end of the twentieth century. Curator and art historian Candice M. Hamelin selected exemplary works by more than twenty photographers. The book, which is published to accompany a major exhibition at the Reinbeckhallen in Berlin—opens with black-and-white photographs of Berlin in ruins and concludes with images of Berlin’s urban development projects after the fall of the Berlin Wall that are often in color and taken with exposure times of up to several years. Images that belong to the genres of street, subjective, architectural, conceptual, portrait, and experimental photography can be found between these two sections. In dialogue with each other, the images in Berlin, 1945–2000: A Photographic Subject underscore the immense social, cultural, and political changes the city underwent and, at the same time, the diverse photographic practices and tendencies that developed in Berlin over the course of fifty-five years.         Photographers in alphabetical order:  Wilfried Bauer, Sibylle Bergemann, Kurt Buchwald, Arno Fischer, Nan Goldin, Herbert Hensky, Max Jacoby, Karl-Ludwig Lange, Will McBride, Rudi Meisel, Roger Melis, Evelyn Richter, Andreas Rost, Michael Schmidt, Gundula Schulze-Eldowy, Maria Sewcz, Michael Wesely, Anno Wilms, Ulrich Wüst, Werner Zellien, Harf Zimmermann, and Miron Zownir

Kontinent,Ostkreuz–Agency of Photographers,false,"“CONTINENT—In Search of Europe” is the new publication and exhibition project of OSTKREUZ—Agency of Photographers, Berlin. On an irregular basis the agency members designate a common topic for them to work on for several years. After To the West, East of Eden, Deutschlandbilder, Ostzeit, The City, On Borders, KONTINENT is the seventh joint thematic publication of the agency members. Over the past three decades they have received recognition in Germany and abroad for their high-quality artistic, documentary photojournalism. In times of shrinking markets for agencies and photographers, OSTKREUZ is truly one of the rare wonders of Berlin. As an artistic and political statement, the twenty-two photographers of the agency focus on the European present with their highly contemporary but diverse photographic series. In this project, the OSTKREUZ photographers explore various aspects of coexistence in Europe, focusing on personal, social, and political phenomena as well as fundamental structures and historical  developments. They always find access to complex content through pictures of people and their environments. The themes of the series range from questions of identity and security, renationalization, migration, and integration to a fundamental understanding of humanism, democracy, and freedom of expression. KONTINENT attempts to offer fruitful impulses for the current debate on Europe by asking questions such as: What connects us? How do we live together? How will our continent develop? How will its people live together? And who exactly does “we” refer to when we are speaking about Europe?
The book is published on the occasion of the exhibition of the same name at the Akademie der Künste, Berlin.

Give my Regards to Elizabeth,Peter Bialobrzeski,true,"This book is a record of Peter Bialobrzeski’s time in England in the early 1990’s, when he finished his studies at the Folkwang School, Essen with a one year DAAD stipend at the London College of Communication. The publication is his diploma work, made in two handbound, then still completely analogue made dummy books. Now, 27 years later the book is published as an almost facsimile version of the original layout.
Coming from a post-unification booming, optimistic Germany economy he found a country and an economy in recession with growing unemployment, declining optimism. Thatcherite capitalism had left it’s deep marks on the faces of people and places. He wanted to capture the class ridden society he was unfamiliar with as a citizen of Germany. The book and his pictures can be seen as a historical document influenced by the british colour photography of the 80’s. In some pictures one can already see the ideas and visual concepts that would make him famous, 20 book publications and numerous exhibitions later Peter Bialobrzeski’s work has been exhibited in Europe, the United States, Asia, Africa and Australia. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including the prestigious World Press Photo Award (2003 and 2010). In2012 he was granted the Dr. Erich Salomon Award by the German Society of Photographers. He is teaching at the HBK in Bremen.
Co-published with Dewi Lewis in the UK and North-America.

Tree and Soil,Robert Knoth & Antoinette de Jong,false,"Eight years after their now-legendary publication Poppy—Trails of Afghan Heroin, Robert Knoth and Antoinette de Jong have completed their next long-term project, Tree and Soil. Following the 2011 nuclear disaster they photographed and filmed the changing landscapes in the closed zones around Fukushima over a period of five years. They documented evacuated farmhouses, gardens, agricultural fields, and the surrounding hills and forests and interviewed former inhabitants of the area. In this book they combine their own landscape photography with historical material from the collection of naturalist and explorer Philipp Franz von Siebold. In the early nineteenth century Siebold had the opportunity to travel throughout Japan and to take home not only vast quantities of artefacts as well as plant and animal specimens, but also a treasure trove of woodblock prints made by artists such as Kawahara Keiga. Siebold’s collections—now in the possession of Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, the Netherlands—illustrate how Japanese culture is deeply rooted in and inspired by nature. Siebold perfectly represents the mindset that became typical for the Age of Exploration -and onwards- in which explorers started to travel the globe to uncover the secrets of the natural world and all its treasures for the benefit of humankind. This era can be seen as a prequel to the Anthropocene, in which our planet has been profoundly changed by human activity. In Tree and Soil Knoth and de Jong underline the intrinsic beauty and value of nature, connecting the past and present by documenting and interpreting the transformations of the deserted landscapes around Fukushima.
„At times we felt like archaeologists of the future, trying to understand what happened in a distant past when a mysterious force resulted in the evacuation of towns, villages, and forests, leaving only a residue of human presence.“
This book has been long in the making. It was carefully edited by the authors with curator Iris Sikking, designed by Kummer&Herrman, renowned Dutch designers of many award-winning photobooks, and beautifully produced by printer Rob Stolk in a very limited one-time edition.
About the photographers
Robert Knoth (*1963, Rotterdam) and Antoinette de Jong (*1964, Tilburg) are based in the Netherlands. They have received numerous awards, and their work has been featured in many solo and group exhibitions in leading festivals and museums. Website
Quote Robert Knoth and Antoinette de Jong
„Digital technologies have caused a seismic change to our position as documentary makers, giving us endless possibilities in narrative formats. We started experimenting with more layered forms of storytelling fusing the hyperrealism of documentary with the more abstract and conceptual qualities within the visual arts.“

Hypothesis,Henrik Spohler,false,"The photographic project Hypothesis by Henrik Spohler addresses the world of science and research in analytical, documentary images and poses questions about our relationship to nature and the environment. His photographs show experiments and scientific facilities on the edge of what is technically feasible. The photo essay with approx. 50 images are divided into four sections: The chapter “Time” deals with geological time, time measurement and the existence of the universe. The chapter “Space” shows, among other things, satellites or observatories that look into the depths of space. “Matter” provides insights into research on the smallest parts of nature and “Life” deals with basic research on animal and plant organisms and humans. The four topics complement each other and create a photo series with its very own cosmos—a pictorial mega-laboratory that is partly detached from the outside world and obeys a single goal without any concrete specification: to provide the world of tomorrow with new insights. In a world where it has become politically possible to ignore or even negate scientific findings, the Hypothesis project uses documentary photography to show a complex and highly developed scientific system as the basis for an enlightened and future-minded society.

Die Eiche,Werner Mahler,false,"This book was written without the knowledge or assistance of Werner Mahler in a secret “mission” and was handed over to him and all guests at the birthday party on the evening of 8 March.  Surprisingly, it is the first book (apart from smaller booklets from the 70s, 80s) dedicated only to his pictures – it was about time!  The oak tree in the pictures, stands at the end of the Mahler’s garden, behind it begins the forest of the Mark Brandenburg. For more than four decades they have been watching the tree grow. For ten years this tree has been Werner Mahler’s visual school – over the seasons, in sun, fog, rain, snow, thunderstorms, day and night … The book is a private print for friends and acquaintances of Werner Mahler and is only available in single copies.

Farmers,Francesco Neri,false,"In 2018 the Italian photographer Francesco Neri won the first August Sander Prize for Portrait Photography of the Photographische Sammlung/SK Stiftung Kultur, Cologne, with his portrait study of farmers in his northern Italian homeland. Neri, who studied with Guido Guidi in Ravenna, comes from the analogue tradition of Italian photography. His carefully composed portraits of men, women and children of family owned farms are surprisingly small, as he prints them as contacts from his 8×10 inch color- or black-and-white negatives. As a result they can be reproduced in full size in this book. The light, the backgrounds, the posture, the body language, the gaze of the portrayed people shaped by physical labour are central elements of his quiet images, which document the past, and present and question the future of the still small-scale, family driven, village structures in todays more and more industrialised and globalised agricultural world.
Francesco Neri (*1982) is Professor of Photography at the Institute for Graphic Design in Faenza and a member of the AA School of Architecture, London. For more than ten years he has been working on various long-term photographic projects, especially in the field of portraiture, but also landscape and interiors are among his fields of interest. “Farmers” is his second monographic publication!

Hinterland,Hans-Christian Schink,false,"The German term “Hinterland“ describes the sparsely populated areas off the cities. As the title of this book it refers to the remote regions of Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, surrounding the greater area of Berlin. Hans-Christian Schink explains: “On the other hand, the title Hinterland also refers to the imaginary landscapes that emerge from my memory. Landscapes that I know from my childhood….so this series is not about portraying concrete places. My pictures are more the result of a search without a destination.” In his project, that he pursues since 2012, Hans-Christian Schink tries to keep a balance of showing the brittle beauty of this form of landscape whilst transporting an atmosphere of melancholy, which stems from the endangerment of this landscape caused by the permanent exploitation of its resources. The titles of his pictures, using the regular names of the locations, such as „Bei Kublank, Plath, Cölpin, Bei Woldegk, Am Wanzkaer See“ etc. – have an unfamiliar if not strange, foreign or outdated sound even to German native speakers.
Hans-Christian Schink, born in Erfurt in 1961, studied at the Academy of Visual Arts in Leipzig. He is considered one of the most important representatives of contemporary photography in Germany. His works, mostly landscape studies in the field of tension between nature and civilization, are exhibited internationally and can be found in important public and private collections.

Beam Lines Spring Stroke,Nam Tchun-Mo,true,"Nam Tchun-Mo (*1961 in Yeongyang) represents a new era of Dansaekhwa, the South Korean art movement that already in the 1960s was radically abstract, largely monochrome. There is a unique consistency in his reduction of the drawn line, which he simultaneously interprets in three dimensions. Resin-hardened fabrics give his ideas a sculptural dimension. Lines and surfaces become heights and depths, which he often colors chronochromatically. Recently he developed objects in space, which now finally translate the sculptural paintings into threedimensionality. The comprehensive book is published on the occasion of his first large museum exhibition in Europe and presents his drawings, paintings, and sculptures, as well as their installations in exhibitions and museum spaces in a congenially designed book.

Budapest Diary,Peter Bialobrzeski,true,"Budapest Diary, September 18 – September 24, 2017
About the City Diaries
In his global, long-term project planned for 50 volumes (begun in 2013), Peter Bialobrzeski poses the question of whether the conception of the image of a city, shaped by prejudices, pre-existing notions, and media representations, can be translated into real images. He is interested in the cultural differences visible in each cityscape. He poses the question of what has already been superimposed by increasing globalization, or what remains visible. With his consistent, seemingly objectifying visual language, this epochal, documentary experiment can be wonderfully comprehended in each book and especially by comparing the individual books, e.g. for New York or Norderney.
Peter Bialobrzeski’s work has been exhibited worldwide. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including two World Press Photo Awards (2003, 2010). In 2012 he was granted the Dr. Erich Salomon Award by the German Photographic Society.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Budapest.jpg,,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/peter-bialobrzeski-budapest-diary-2/
One-day Visa for East-Berlin,Udo Hesse,false,"“In the early eighties, the photographer Udo Hesse, at the time living in West Berlin, walked with his camera through East Berlin, a place that to him was strangely familiar and disconcerting at the same time . . . The postwar period lasted long in both parts of the city and even longer in the east . . . The result is a photographic document that laconically, silently, and yet impressively tells of the past in a vanished country” (from Andreas Krase’s foreword). In the appendix Udo Hesse also tells of his encounter with the East Berlin Police and the Stasi. He rediscovered a few prints of his then confiscated negatives in his Stasi files in 2007. More than thirty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hesse’s photographs can now be seen in a new and different light. The viewer’s inner eye involuntarily compares the images of the past with the present of Berlin’s new center.

Tempora Morte,Lia Darjes,false,"During a residency in Kaliningrad (formerly East Prussia) Lia Darjes discovered the small improvised market stands on the roadsides of this neglected area largely cut off from the development of modern Europe. The Kaliningrad “oblast” was a military area with heavily restricted access until 1991 and since the end of the USSR has been a Russian exclave isolated between the EU members Poland and Lithuania. On the simplest improvised stands old women offer what they harvest with their hands from their gardens, nearby fields and forests to supplement their feeble pensions. The pictures live from the aura of simplicity and plainness of the presentation of goods on the ground, on wooden boxes, newspapers or simple camping tables. Lia Darje’s pictures show what is on offer in a classic, almost timeless impression: Potatoes, apples, berries, owers, garlic tubers, homemade marmalade, and most exceptionally a piece of meat. Her still lives are complimented by a few portraits of market women and traders. With the pictures of Tempora Morte in her first photobook Lia Darjes aims to develop a relationship of the classical still life genre with contemporary documentary photography.

Where Have All The Flowers Gone,Tom Hunter,false,"Tom Hunter is known for his social documentary projects investigating alternative communities, contemporary music and experimental cultures in London and across Europe. Inspired by this, Hunter takes us to the Glastonbury Festival in his book ”Where have all the flowers gone“. From it’s beginnings in the 70’s this festival was driven by the ethos of the hippie movements. At the 2017 festival Hunter set up his ”naked truth photo booth“ and asked festivalgoers to stand naked for portraits inside the wooden booth. In the spirit of the first Summer of Love they were asked to reimagine the liberation of that era and embrace the freedom of nudity. Hunter took their portraits on a medium format film camera in the classical tradition of 19th century portrait photographers.
The book is accompanied by text and images by Hunter’s parents, based on their visit to the legendary 1970 ”Isle of Wight“ festival and their experiences of freedom, liberty and counter culture in the early 70’s. The images by Hunter create a contemporary vision of today’s festival culture whilst at the same time evoking a nostalgic, historical view of that first Summer of Love.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1-hunter_cover.jpg,https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1-hunter_1.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1-hunter_2.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1-hunter_3.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1-hunter_4.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1-hunter_5.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1-hunter_6.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1-hunter_7.jpg,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/tom-hunter-where-have-all-the-flowers-gone-en/
A Journey through Germany. The NSU Serial Murders,Paula Markert,false,"The verdict of the five-year NSU (National Socialist Underground) murder trial was announced in Munich in July 2018. The so-called NSU Trial is a milestone in postwar German jurisdiction that deeply challenged the understanding of democracy of all those who were directly and indirectly involved. Beate Zschäpe, the sole survivor of the NSU terror cell, and four supporters were eventually sentenced to prison terms. For eleven years the NSU committed right-wing-extremist-motivated murders in Germany, claiming the lives of ten people. The series of murders ended with the discovery of the corpses of Uwe Böhnhardt and Uwe Mundlos in 2011. Only then did the judiciary discover the connections between the victims, who had long been under suspicion themselves, and the right-wing extremist movement. From fall 2014 to spring 2017 the Hamburg-based documentary photographer Paula Market (*1982) traveled through Germany, following in the footsteps of the NSU and documenting people and places associated with the NSU. Her photos of crime scenes and holiday retreats of the murderers are juxtaposed with portraits of victims, lawyers, and institutions. Markert’s photographs are combined with twelve selected text fragments and excerpts from interviews, providing a multifaceted impression of the events and, above all, of the many inconsistencies that remain incomprehensible to this day—questioning the due diligence obligations of the state and the role of the Federal Republic of Germany’s domestic intelligence service. This printed and bound book is intended to save the trial and the victims from the rapid digital oblivion of our times!

Huts Hedges Heaps,Ingar Krauss,false,"The book Huts Hedges Heaps (Ingar Krauss’s second publication with Hartmann Books after 39 Bilder of 2016) is about human order in nature. The laconic photographs of small, rural gardens that Krauss shot between 2010 and 2017 particularly in Brandenburg show concentrated traces of human efforts to create order, which take on graphic and sculptural dimensions in the pictures’ structure. In the Black Forest he produced pictures of wood piles, whose man-made forms seem even more abstract because they organically fit into the structures of their natural surroundings, recalling the work of Land artists. The huts, hedges, and heaps are connected to the American New Topographic movement of the 1970s insofar as they “fulfill everything that people wanted in a picture in those days, overturning an observation into a ‘higher’ order of some kind; the monumentalization of the everyday, not by resorting to monumentalizing genres, but by the captivating composition of the image,” as Ulf Erdmann Ziegler writes.

No Buddha in Suburbia,Peter Bialobrzeski,true,"In ‟No Buddha in Suburbia” Peter Bialobrzeski returns to Asia, for his new photographical case study in urbanism and humanity. After his last major series ‟Die zweite Heimat” on his native Germany (with a touring exhibition and sold out book) he followed an invitation of the Goethe Institute to Mumbai. Mumbai’s Suburbia counts as one of the largest urban sprawls on the planet and in contrary to the western notion of the word, it is a dystopian environment. The overpopulated streets are lined with an eclectic mix of derelict buildings, high rises, slums and huge billboards. The population density is 22.000 people/km²! In the pictures for this series Peter Bialobrzeski tries to condense these highly intense and complex impressions in impressive tableaus that are presented in this publication for the first time.
Peter Bialobrzeskis work has been exhibited in Europe, USA, Asia, Africa and Australia. He won several awards including the prestigious World Press Photo Award 2003 and 2010.
Rahul Mehrotra, the author of the essay is principal of architecture firm RMA Architects (Mumbai/Boston) and professor of Urban Design and Planning at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. He is active in various movements for architectural preservation and urban development in India such as the Indian Institute for Human Settlement.

Image Finder,Gerhard Vormwald,false,"Gerhard Vormwald, (*1948, Mannheim) died in Paris in 2016. He became first known internationally in the 80’s. With his surreal pictorial stagings and montages, he visually leverages gravity and our imagination even before the creation of Photoshop. In his montages, people float, water eats up, things dance in space to surreal choreographies. This book gives an overview of his found and invented visual worlds – from early documentary images (On the Road), to architectural montages (Concrete Illusions), image pairings (Blind Date Essentials), surrealistic (Autonomy of Things) and negative (Black Light) alienated still lifes and a few of the pictures of his advertising work. The poetic „unrealization“ of the world, which Vormwald pursued with fervour, proofs his cheerful lust for the absurd and mysterious. The reason why he is almost forgotten today can be explained by his bulkiness and that his pictures cannot be reduced to an easily recognizable trademark. It would certainly be worthwhile to dive even deeper into his extensive archive for future publications and exhibitions!

The Moment in Space,Barbara Probst,false,"Born in 1964 in Munich, Barbara Probst studied sculpture at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Munich and photography at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. After starting out as a sculptor, she has been working on photographic series entitled “Exposures” since 2000. Each of these series consists of various representations of the same moment, generated by a multitude of cameras pointed at the same event or subject, from different angles and at different distances. Once the images are linked to each other, an enigmatic drama emerges from these sets, calling to mind different photographic genres (from portrait to still life, landscape or studio photography). Bringing to light the artefacts of the photographic process and focusing on representation strategies, Barbara Probst challenges our ability to decipher reality. The book features both her first emblematic works such as Exposure #1 (2000) and her most recent series created in 2018, Exposures # 138, 139 and 140. In his essay the author Frédéric Paul (curator at Centre Pompidou, Paris) explores the conceptual and theoretical background of Probst’s work by explaining her process of conceptualising and creating the exposures as well as aspects of installation and exhibition and the impact on the viewer.

Ironwork by Paul Zimmermann,Atelier Zimmermann,false,"This book presents the work of the Swabian blacksmith Paul Zimmermann. Since opening his studio (Atelier Zimmermann) in 1963, in Pliezhausen (southwestern Germany, near Tübingen facing the Swabian Alb), he created several hundred tombs and a variety of fountains, gates, signs and self assigned works. Zimmermann constantly tries to challenge the boundaries of the medium, his craft as a blacksmith. Experiments in materiality and form accompany his work since he started as an apprentice. In his work he uses new technical and creative ways in the attempt to give contemporary form and meaning to ancient materials such as iron, copper, bronze and other metals. For him the idea comes first, then the craft, the forging. He approaches the tasks assigned to him by research and then slowly develops the respective conclusive form. His works, which alternate between minimalist and expressive approaches, stand out from the artisan forging production of the post-war period to the present day. They have been recognised nationally and internationally, shown and published at exhibitions (for example in the Victoria & Albert Museum, London). This book, published on the occasion of his 80th birthday, is the first comprehensive monographic publication of his work, his studio, his workshop – his life.

Berlin: The City´s Edge 1993/94,André Kirchner,false,"To mark the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, this book premieres the series “Stadtrand Berlin” (Berlin: The City’s Edge) by André Kirchner (*1958), acclaimed Berlin documentary photographer who took the pictures of the then reunited city along its historical border between 1993 and 1994. Kirchner chose a perspective looking inwards on the city from outside. The geographical starting-point was the former border crossing at Drewitz. Moving anti-clockwise, within a year he reached Glienicker Brücke, a bridge on the other side of Potsdam. The 60 single exposures construct a view of the periphery of Greater Berlin within the 234-km boundary defined in 1920, when other parishes were absorbed into the city, which corresponds roughly to its current footprint. The documentary series features not only relics of the Berlin Wall but also farmsteads indicating a rural lifestyle, long avenues, factory ruins left behind by advancing 20th-century industrialisation, and modern-day satellite communities. Kirchner’s quiet panoramas subtly expose traces of 100 years of urban history in a last moment of silence before the rapid post-reunification developments would change these places forever.

Zurich Diary,Peter Bialobrzeski,true,"Zurich Diary, February 26 – March 4, 2018
About the City Diaries
In his global, long-term project planned for 50 volumes (begun in 2013), Peter Bialobrzeski poses the question of whether the conception of the image of a city, shaped by prejudices, pre-existing notions, and media representations, can be translated into real images. He is interested in the cultural differences visible in each cityscape. He poses the question of what has already been superimposed by increasing globalization, or what remains visible. With his consistent, seemingly objectifying visual language, this epochal, documentary experiment can be wonderfully comprehended in each book and especially by comparing the individual books, e.g. for New York or Norderney.
Peter Bialobrzeski’s work has been exhibited worldwide. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including two World Press Photo Awards (2003, 2010). In 2012 he was granted the Dr. Erich Salomon Award by the German Photographic Society.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Zurich.jpg,,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/peter-bialobrzeski-zurich-diary-2/
Kleinstadt,Ute & Werner Mahler,false,"An empty square in a small town: almost devoid of people, and those who are there are either very old or very young. There are no sights to see, only empty storefronts, slow decay, and—if you’re lucky—a touch of morbid charm. It is the kind of place that you only come to by chance, and you are compelled to ask yourself: Who is here when I am not here—and why?
According to the definition of the Imperial Office of Statistics in 1887, which is valid in Germany to this day, a small town (Kleinstadt in German) has between five and twenty thousand inhabitants. Ute and Werner Mahler chose to investigate the demographic phenomenon of small towns in their fourth collaboration following Monalisen der Vorstädte (Mona Lisas of the Suburbs), completed in 2010; Wo die Welt zu Ende war (Where the World Ended), completed in 2012; and seltsame Tage (Strange Days), completed in 2014. Starting in 2012 they traveled around Germany in a small car with a large camera and a supply of black-and-white sheet film in search of images that document the atmosphere, attitude, and spirit of these places.
Their concise images freeze time and place, capturing the idea of a small town in a kaleidoscope of images from many small cities, ranging from Bad Gandersheim to Lebach and Zörbig. The future of such small towns will be decided in the next few years. Young people are the future; if they leave, small towns will die.

Blind Spots,Balder Olrik,false,"“Blind Spots” is a study of our auto-perception. It’s an investigation of what we see when we see – and what we unconsciously choose not to see. The one question we instantly ask our self, when exposed to a new environment is: “Where am I?” But as soon as we know the context of the perceived, we immediate loose interest. Balder Olrik is inspired by Nobel laureate, Daniel Kahneman’s model for the perceptual systems of the brain. He disrupts our viewing habits, for example by removing context-specific elements from the image, to make the familiar, unfamiliar and make us look at our environment more consciously. This is the first book on Olriks photographic work. After an early career as a painter in the 80’s, Olrik became a part of the pioneering community around digital media, and the uprising internet in the 90’s, where his main focus was behavioural science. In1998 he stoped his artistic career, solely focusing on the digital projects. In the 2014 he switched back to work as an artist, mainly focused on the photographic media, were he combines his artistic skills with the knowledge of human perception and behaviour.
Balder Olrik was born in 1966, into a family of scientists in the area of Copenhagen, where he still lives and works.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Balder_cover_720.jpg,https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bo_1_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bo_2_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bo_3_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bo_4_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bo_5_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bo_6_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bo_7_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bo_8_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cover_u1_blindspots_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Balder_cover_Back_720.jpg,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/balder-olrik-blind-spots-en/
Sibylle – Zeitschrift für Mode und Kultur,Sibylle – Zeitschrift für Mode und Kultur,false,"„Sibylle“ was THE most read magazine for fashion, art and culture in the GDR. Named after the first editor -in-chief Sibylle Gerstner it was published six times a year in a limited printrun of 200.000 copies due to the restrictions of the state-directed economy in the socialist peoples republic. Sometimes it was referred to as the „Eastern Vogue“ thanks to the quality, diversity and inventiveness of the fashion, styling, photography, editing and design of the magazine. The editors, authors, photographers, designers were mostly intellectuals with a great range of interests, tastes and very high standards of visual and textual storytelling. Sibylle like all media in the GDR was under political censorship but as it was considered as „only“ a fashion magazine – so the agitation department of the communist party was more relaxed about its contents than for political media and daily newspapers. The editors were constantly challenging and testing this censorship for the sake of the education, entertainment and inspiration of their readers.
The visual language of „Sibylle“ was trendsetting for the GDR and other magazines in the Communist world of postwar Europe. Unlike most of it’s western competitors „Sibylle“ was not limited to fashion, cooking and homecare themes – the makers were taking advantage of the rather light censorship to pick whatever story they were interested in and create a highly inventive, experimental magazine, reporting on all kinds of cultural themes and events beside the fashion and photography focus, thus promoting early on an emancipated picture of the modern women.
The book showcases the photographers, fashion- and graphic designers, models, writers, editors as well as the political and sociocultural background of „Sibylles’“ almost 50 year long publishing history as the definitive publication on an important chapter of German media history.

Wuhan Diary,Peter Bialobrzeski,true,"Wuhan Diary, February 22 – March 12, 2017
About the City Diaries
In his global, long-term project planned for 50 volumes (begun in 2013), Peter Bialobrzeski poses the question of whether the conception of the image of a city, shaped by prejudices, pre-existing notions, and media representations, can be translated into real images. He is interested in the cultural differences visible in each cityscape. He poses the question of what has already been superimposed by increasing globalization, or what remains visible. With his consistent, seemingly objectifying visual language, this epochal, documentary experiment can be wonderfully comprehended in each book and especially by comparing the individual books, e.g. for New York or Norderney.
Peter Bialobrzeski’s work has been exhibited worldwide. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including two World Press Photo Awards (2003, 2010). In 2012 he was granted the Dr. Erich Salomon Award by the German Photographic Society.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Wuhan.jpg,,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/peter-bialobrzeski-wuhan-diary-2/
The Architecture of Transit,Sue Barr,false,"Motorways are architectural megastructures in the landscape, crossing nations, natural or political borders making previously remote places accessible to development, tourism and trade. Between the Alps and Naples motorways connect highly complex topographies and urban conditions, often retracing antique trade paths and routes taken by northern Romantics on the Grand Tour, searching for arcadian and sublime landscapes as painted by de Loutherbourg, Claude and Turner.
The experience of the sublime in untamed nature became a highlight on the Grand Tour. Landscapes that once took days to cross, today we speed through via motorways over concrete bridges, ramps, through galleries and tunnels. But with this speed comes a new accelerated and simultaneously calm sublime of concrete motorway megastructures.
Sue Barr (Head of Photography, Architectural Association, London) is a photographer obsessed by concrete and Brutalist architecture. Following historical 18th-century routes from the Swiss Alps to Naples, she used a large format camera to photograph these extraordinary and ignored architectural megastructures. The pictures in her first monographic publication, document the ominous beauty of motorway architecture, within landscapes and urban spaces through carefully constructed photographs.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hbsue-barr-cover-neu_665.jpg,https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1_SueBarr_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2_SueBarr_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/3_SueBarr_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/4_SueBarr_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/5_SueBarr_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/6_SueBarr_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hb_sue_barr_007_665px.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hb_sue_barr_008_665px.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hb_sue_barr_009_665px.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hb_sue_barr_010_665px.jpg,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/sue-barr-the-architecture-of-transit-en/
Photographic,Anne Collier,false,"Anne Collier (b. 1970) lives and works in New York. In her work she uses and processes found photographs, edits them and this way reaches a reflected history of the photographic medium. She fit mainly interested in pictures that can be characterised by a very emotional visual language: eyes, clouds, waves as well as photographs of outright romanticised sexism. By photographing posters, album covers, photo magazines, book pages and film stills, the artist questions the significance of pictures that shape our everyday lives and illustrate desires. By addressing the theme of taking photographs itself and reproducing existing photos, she creates distance to the motifs, filtering out emotions and thus providing an inducement to reflect on the depiction. Her exceedingly analytical perspective foregoes sentimentality or pathos. As such, the viewer – whether male or female – is challenged to take a stance. Anne Collier’s works have already been shown at numerous international group and solo exhibitions, for example at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Centre Pompidou, Paris, the Fondazione Prada, Milan (all 2016), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (2014), and the Frac Normandie (2018). This publication presents an overview of her works from the past 11 years.

Once upon a time in Moldavia,Vasilii Lefter,false,"lost&found
This new photo book(let) series presents analogue photographs and picture archives. Intuition, pure chance, odd encounters, and the slow passage of time helped in discovering the images and archives. All of them have their own remarkable stories: the story of the individual photographer, the story of the photographic subject, the story of each archive and its discovery, and not least the visible story of the unavoidable deterioration of analogue photographs, caused by production, use, and storage. All of the images are reproduced unretouched and thus bear the traces of their history, from the depths of their emulsions to their surfaces.
Vasilii Lefter | Once upon a time in Moldavia

The photographs of Vasilii Lefter (1943–1982) were never published during his lifetime. Yet it was always his dream to be taken seriously as a photographer or artist and to have international exhibitions and publications. When his daughter, the artist Tatiana Fiodorova (born in 1976), discovered them, the boxed images had been gathering dust for twenty- five years on the balcony of her parents’ apartment in Chișinău, the capital of Moldavia. Lefter left behind a Kiev camera and countless small-format photographs, negatives, rolls of film, drawings and paintings, and stencils and drawings for the propaganda posters that he had designed and painted as a freelance graphic designer—a position that could not really exist in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic—for the kolkhozes of the region. He gave up his conformist but unsatisfying desk job at the Ministry of Building, where he had been employed since 1970. Lefter was self-taught, his photographs were black and white, and he developed his small-format pictures in his bathroom at home. He spent a large portion of his meager earnings on his passion for photography. He often spent weekends in the countryside around Chișinău, where he photographed the villagers in their gardens, at weddings, in the forest, or in community rooms. Family members posed for his camera, often as couples. Babies and status symbols such as portable radios, which often reappear in his pictures, were often shared by the sitters as props. The often identical clothing bears witness to the uniformity of Communist fashion. Now, thirty-six years after his death and twenty-eight years after the fall of the Iron Curtain, the photographs are being shown for the first time in an international exhibition—the fulfilment of his dream.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Lefter_cover_720.jpg,https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/lefter_3_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/lefter_1_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/lefter_2_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/lefter_4_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/lefter_5_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/lefter_6_720.jpg,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/vasilii-lefter-once-upon-a-time-in-moldavia/

No Ruined Stone,Paul Duke,false,"“No Ruined Stone” by Scottish photographer Paul Duke offers a timely and far-reaching insight into a fractured and deprived housing estate in Edinburgh. Returning to Muirhouse — the backdrop to Irvine Welsh’s novel “Trainspotting“ — Duke’s documentary and poetical photographs lead us through the estate he grew up in. Although circumspect questions of social inequity are raised in the book the underlying narrative is about fighting spirit, dignity and hope of the residents living there today.
Paul Duke was born and educated in Edinburgh. He gained a Master of Arts degree with distinction from the Royal College of Art in 1989. As well as exhibiting in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery he has shown in the Scottish Parliament and was included in the National Galleries of Scotland landmark exhibition “Light from the Dark Room” in 1995. “No Ruined Stone” is his second publication after “At Sea”, published in 2013. The text is written by Martin Barnes, senior curator of photography, Victoria & Albert Museum, London.

Greetings from Turkey,Norman Behrendt,false,"Since 2014 Berlin-based photographer Norman Behrendt (*1981) has been documenting newly built neo-ottoman-style mosques in the sprawling suburbs of Ankara and Istanbul.
His pictures reflect how Turkey has changed over the last decades from Atatürk’s secularism to the Islamic state under Erdogan. Since 1987, the number of mosques in Turkey has grown from 60,000 to more than 85,000 in 2013, an increase of almost 1,000 mosques per year. This small, experimentally bound booklet presents a selection of works from the ongoing project “Brave New Turkey.” A larger book will be published when the series is completed. The two different covers imitate two types of Turkish passports: green with EU visa facilitation, and red without.

GreedFearLove,Loredana Nemes,false,"In the last ten years, Loredana Nemes (b. 1972) has intensively engaged with the subjects of identity and personality. In the process, deeply personal and political issues flow into her work. The most comprehensive monograph on her oeuvre to date, which is being published in conjunction with a large solo exhibition at the Berlinische Galerie, presents six large series. In two of them she explores primal human emotions such as “fear,” for which she photographed blurry portraits of truck fronts, and “greed,” in which she depiced seagulls mercilessly hunting for food. In her work Onca: An Approach she presents male body fragments, and in beyond the foreignness of other cultures. Blossom Time depicts the transformation process of adolescence, and The Presentation deals with the subject of identity and group membership by means of portraits of costumed carnival revelers.
Despite her very clear, conceptual approach, all of Nemes’s images have a secretive, mysterious component that lends the works a great depth and allows the viewer to develop an emotional, personal connection to them.
Nemes has been shaped by three different cultures: born in Romania, she resided for a time in Iran and today lives in Germany. Insecurities about and fears of the other as well as openness and curiosity toward the other distinguish her and her work.

39 Bilder,Ingar Krauss,false,"After a number of catalogues, »39 Pictures« is now the second monograph on Ingar Krauss (*1965, Berlin). His first book, »Portraits« (2005), featuring portraits of children and teenagers, revealed his independent position on today’s fine arts photography scene.
In »39 Pictures« Ingar Krauss presents thirty-nine still lifes, whose contents are derived from the rural environment surrounding his photography studio in Oderbruch. Vegetables, fruit, grain, flowers, and animals are photographed in analogue technique under natural light in self-constructed, stage-like boxes. They’ve been developed in his own darkroom, and finally, enlarged by hand and glazed in oil paint. His pictures look surreal, sometimes gloomy, always timeless; they obey no trend and cannot be attributed to any school. His inspiration comes from his immediate experience of landscape, farming, the seasons of the year, and atmospheres, although these new pictures are more akin to portraits than still lifes.
Hartmann Books worked closely with Krauss and the publisher Suzy Shammah on the books design. Binding and paper are carefully chosen to present the photographs in a congenial book form.
Ulf Erdmann Ziegler’s essay in both German and English (»He Who Lives Still Lifes Lives Inside«) is more than just the usual sort of text that accompanies today’s photography books. His essay reenacts the way that one looks at the photographs; it’s an independent and very readable literary commentary on the visual tasks of the still life, its history, and its contents.

"Design, Revolt, Rainbow",Fleckhaus,false,"Published to coincide with the traveling exhibition at MAK Cologne, Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe,  Hamburg and Villa Stuck, Munich, further venues planned.
Willy Fleckhaus (1925–1983) was one of the most innovative, creative and influential graphic designers in postwar Germany. He became internationally known for his groundbreaking work on the lifestyle magazine twen, which attracted generations of readers with its generous layouts, modern typography and distinctive choice of house photographers such as (among others) Will McBride, Charlotte March, Guido Mangold, Reinhart Wolf. He invented the position of the „art director“, when this job description did not yet exist in Germany and earned himself the nickname of “Germany’s most expensive pencil”. Beside his longterm involvement with twen he worked for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Magazine (from 1980 onwards), the magazine Quick, developed book series such as edition suhrkamp with its famous rainbow-coloured covers, exhibition designs for the Photokina trade fair in Cologne, and the logo of the Westdeutscher Rundfunk broadcasting corporation. The book, the first comprehensive monograph on Willy Fleckhaus in an international edition, includes texts by Michael Koetzle and Carsten Wolff (who also took over the book design), both long time collectors of Fleckhaus work samples.

Hope is a risk that must be run,Robert Adams,false,"The challenge when planning this concise publication was what to add to the impressive list of publications on Robert Adams. The carefully selected pictures published in this booklet come from the rare street photographs Adams took of urban and suburban Americans in the 70’s, at the time living near Denver, Colorado. The feeling of fateful helplessness when seeing smoke rise over the nearby nuclear weapons plant caused Adams to portray his fellow citizens in their daily routines as a metaphor about the value of life in the shadow of existential catastrophe.
Robert Adams, born 1937, became a photographer in the mid-1960s. He is part of the New Topographics movement and published more than forty books, most of them focusing on the american landscape.

Imperium Romanum Opus Extractum II,Alfred Seiland,false,"In the year 2006 A.D. Alfred Seiland set out on his project ”Imperium Romanum“.
What started as an interesting assignment (by the New York Times Magazine) to accompany the shooting of the HBO Series ”Rome“ in Cinecittà, turned into a thorough, longterm photographic research of the remains and of Roman culture, architecture, landscape and art in the early 21st century.
Using his brilliantly imaginative, sometimes ironic photographic language, taking buildings, landscapes, and artefacts of the Roman Empire as a point of reference, Alfred Seiland creates an in-depth visual documentation of the interwoven histories and cultures of Europe and the Mediterranean hemisphere.
This book is the second in a series of ”Opus Extractum“ volumes. It explores 58 locations in 22 countries all over the territory of the former Roman Empire and beyond. All pictures are accompanied by longer explanatory captions which make references to the historical and modern, visible and invisible aspects of the captured places. The introductory essay of the British historian Philip Parkers takes the reader on a literary journey through time and space of the Roman Empire before he can follow Alfred Seiland on his visual journey. ”Imperium Romanum“ is an epic project, both in concept and scope, that goes back deep into the early roots of a common European and Mediterranean culture.

12 Moments,Barbara Probst,false,"Barbara Probst (*1964 in Munich; lives in New York and Munich) studied sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, and photography under Bernd Becher at the Düsseldorf Art Academy. She began her career with sculptural works, then moved on to three-dimensional installations that included photography, and finally, to the multi-part photographic works, the “exposures,” which brought her international renown. 12 Moments presents her new series of diptychs from the year 2015. Unlike her previously, primarily complex, multi-part works of art, which she photographed from a variety of perspectives simultaneously, this new, more minimalist series has been reduced to just two perspectives of the same scene in the same moment. In contrast to her earlier works, the pictures in this series are dreamlike and uncanny. In his extensive essay, Robert Hobbs, the well-known American author, curator, and art historian, puts these new works into the context of Probst’s previous artistic development. The book has been designed in close collaboration with the artist, so that the diptychs can be regarded and perceived as analogous to her visual ideas.

TR 34; Istanbul,Maria Sewcz,false,"Istanbul is a city that is ancient, modern, and of the future, a city of contrasts that was formed by the brutal dynamics of religious, political, economic, and social processes of transformation. Like no other metropolis Istanbul epitomizes the major issues of our era. Maria Sewcz’s photographs give a fascinating analytical interpretation of this development that is taking place before our very eyes, providing a cross section of space and time between Europe, the Balkans, and the Middle and Far East.
The pairs of images in this book present the city in confrontation with itself: joie de vivre and suspicion, the lively chaos of structures, the proximity of ancient ruins to concrete high-rises, rags and riches, and religion and secularism. Her photographs are an expression of a raw energy that is as fascinating as it is frightening. The pictorial world of Maria Sewcz is complimented by a poetic interpretation by Monika Rinck, which is an independent narrative text in itself.

Partitionen,Christiane Feser,false,"Crossing the border between photography and art objects, the works of Christiane Feser (*1977) interact with paper as a material and as an image support. In the series Partitionen (Partitions) photographs of richly varied modular constellations were manually dissected, modified, and reassembled, producing a sculptural, relief-like work from a two-dimensional photograph. These fascinating images defy a cursory, superficial gaze and demand quiet observation and intensive analysis. One is tempted to touch her images, in order to literally “grasp” or understand them, but this is impossible due to their fragility. Christiane Feser’s works are both playfully light and deeply aesthetic. They raise questions about images and copies, and about the connections between space, surface, and the meaning of light, bringing to mind Walter Benjamin’s famous reflections about originals and reproductions.
This publication presents the series Partitionen (transl. Partitions). Essays by Steffen Siegel and Mark Durant analyze the complex images and the process of their creation and place them in an art-historical context. The precisely and minimalistically designed book-object was created and produced by the Frankfurt-based graphic-design studio Pixelgarten in close collaboration with the artist.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Feser_Cover.jpg,https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/4_Feser_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/5_Feser_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/6_Feser_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7_Feser_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/8_Feser_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/9_Feser_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/10_Feser_720.jpg,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/christiane-feser-partitionen-en/
Berlin 1966 – 1970,Arwed Messmer,false,"Fifty years after 1968: The student protests seen from the perspective of the Berlin police force
Over the past decade Arwed Messmer has been working with photographic documents from public archives, using them as the visual basis of his artistic work. In the Police Historical Collection in Berlin he examined the holdings of images taken by the police within the scope of their usual documentation during the student protests of the 1960s. These images, which are published here for the first time, show a different view of the historical events than the press images that dominate our visual memory to this day. For this project Arwed Messmer digitized over one thousand black-and-white negatives, editing them in a sequential narrative structure that breaches the boundary between photography and film.

Ein gutes Bild muss scharf sein!,Arnold Odermatt,false,"This is the first longer biographical text publication on Arnold Odermatt, the policemen from the central Swiss Kanton Nidwalden who became famous with his Karambolage-pictures. As a photographic autodidact he began to document traffic accidents, police service, family and everyday life in postwar Switzerland.

His carefully composed pictures of the aftermath of car accidents keep breaking into the unhurried and idillic scenery of the remote Kanton Nidwalden.

Sherman’s brilliant insights into the construction of identity and uncanny skills as a photographer, model, makeup artist and stylist have made her one of the most important artists in contemporary art. In this latest series Sherman focuses on the first era of Hollywood’s star system that presented complex independent women characterized by exaggerated makeup, modern clothing and seductive poses in 1920s Hollywood publicity photos.

Breaking Point,Triennial of Photography Hamburg,false,"The book to the 2018 Triennial of Photography Hamburg. Every three years since 1999, this large international festival (with ca. 80 exhibitors and over 300 artists) presents an overview of contemporary developments in artistic and documentary photography. The large Hamburg exhibition institutions (Kunsthalle, Museum für Kunst & Gewerbe, Deichtorhallen, etc.) participate in the Triennial with their own exhibitions. The book’s subtitle is also the contextual focus of the event curated by Krzysztof Candrowicz.
The world in the twenty-first century is characterized by constantly accelerating processes of change; mankind is currently undergoing an enormous phase of upheaval. Digitalization, climate change, waves of migration, population explosion, and globalization demand new solutions and ways of thinking. Under the motto “Breaking Point: Searching for Change,” the seventh Triennial of Photography Hamburg takes up this debate. What answers can artists contribute to the discussion? What are the tasks of photography? The works collected in this book as well as the texts by the authors and museum curators have taken up these challenges and reflect on the subject of the “breaking point” in a manner that is highly complex, imaginative, and inspiring.

In Between,Henrik Spohler,false,"Henrik Spohler’s project, »In Between,« investigates the transit sites that are essential to this worldwide stream of commodities, yet are almost never seen by consumers (that is, most of us).The globalization that has occurred over the last two to three decades is characterized by continuous acceleration whose frequency and compulsion are difficult to avoid. Commodities are available to consumers nearly everywhere at any time. Logistical intersections, such as harbors and freight airports, as well as facilities that have been set up along trade corridors, are areas that cater only to economic functions. Seen alone, these places betray no hint of which country or continent they might be located in. The photographs in this project show the flipside of industrial production and commercial trade. Fictitious-looking motifs from nameless territories in Europe and Asia emerge, spreading out and slicing through landscapes.
The images in this landscape sized book are printed on a stock that keeps the balance between reproduction quality and surface feel perfectly well. Each work has a double page reserved for itself, which emphasizes the quiet visual qualities of Spohlers photographs and invites the viewer to study their narrative carefully.
»In Between« consists of fifty-six photographs taken in Spain, Belgium, Poland, the Netherlands, China, and Germany.

State Of Nature,Claudius Schulze,false,"“State of Nature” shows the extent that natural­-disaster protection has become part of the European landscape.
Claudius Schulze traveled about 50.000 km across Europe, photographing seemingly picturesque landscapes from a crane platform with a large­-format camera. But each of those idyllic scenes contains imperfec­tions: alpine panoramas are crossed by snow sheds, the North Sea coast is fur­rowed by breakwaters. In each of the pho­tographs, protective structures rise into the landscape. But these pictures are not about defining the boundary between culture and nature. On the contrary: the pho­tographs demonstrate how much the two spheres penetrate each other.

Peter Dammann | Just Life

The camera was a constant companion in the life of the engineer Peter Dammann (born in 1936). Between the 1960s and 1990s he not only photographed his family, but also people, situations, landscapes, and animals. He produced thousands of images of family celebrations, excursions, birthdays, and funerals. In this way he created a family history of the sort that will be familiar to many. Yet he was more interested in creating good images than in mere documentation. Like many other amateur photographers Dammann looked to established, known photographers and trained his eye with their pictures. Dammann prefered black-and-white photography, and he made his own prints. In his different apartments over the years he had a darkroom in the bathroom, in a storage room, and later in a basement room. He collected everything in orderly, labeled binders, boxes, and crates, carefully organized in plastic sleeves and stored together with the corresponding contact sheets. Those photographs that Dammann considered the best were enlarged to a format of 18×24 centimeters, which he stored in homemade wooden crates. The last roll of black-and-white film that he developed bears the number 422 and is from the year 2007. He digitized the last eighty-nine rolls of black-and-white film himself and then ordered prints from a photo service. Since 2002 his photography and archives are digital.
In spite of his creative ambitions, Peter Dammann never intended to publish his personal family chronicle. His son, the artist Martin Dammann (*1965), encouraged his father to publically show his private photographs for the first time in this publication and in the exhibition at the Opelvillen.

Die zweite Heimat,Peter Bialobrzeski,true,"Five years ago Peter Bialobrzeski began working on his “Second Heimat” project (following the “Heimat” of 2005). Switching his navigation system to “avoid Autobahn,” he traveled through Germany in search of answers to his questions: How and where do Germans live? How do most citizens experience German reality? His journeys brought him to small and medium-sized towns, larger cities, and suburbs and city centers. His magnificently captured and beautifully composed pictures, together with the text by Henning Sußebach about places, non-places, and memories of the German concept of home, make a great book about Germany, the country, and its soul that is hard for foreigners to comprehend.
„More than thirty years after Stephen Shore´s publication Uncommon Places, I decide to take a trip through Germany on the eve of the twenty-fifth anniversary of reunification. I try to describe and fathom the country´s social terrain….. Like Walker Evans, I´m interested in formulating photographically what the present day might look like once it is past. And to quote yet another role model: I want to see what the country where I´ve lived for fifty years looks like in my photographs.“ [Peter Bialobrzeski]

Alex Herrmann | Continental Breakfast
Axel Herrmann (1946–2010) began documenting his exciting life as a commercial pilot in 1967. Although his occupation was flying, his passions were photography, traveling, and, starting in the early 1970s, his wife Heide, a stewardess whom he met shortly after beginning his career as a pilot. Until 1979, when their son Daniel was born, they led the lives of jetsetters, in a way that the advertising agencies of the era could have hardly invented more authentically. The good-looking pilot and the attractive stewardess traveled around the world together, to faraway places like Hawaii, Tokyo, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Bangkok, Hong Kong … During the layovers, which back then were much longer than today, they stayed in luxurious hotels and had time for lengthy excursions, beach holidays, and sightseeing—long before modern mass tourism made traveling far less exclusive. Axel Herrmann always had his camera with him and had a good sense for situations and the right moment. The colors of the his favorite Kodachrome film allow the private memories to shine nostalgically even after five decades. He photographed his wife and favorite model in airplanes, working, in front of tourist attractions, on the beach, at pools, against sunset backdrops, in hotels, with friends and relatives. After his wife’s death in 2002, he destroyed a large part of his film and photo archive. The images shown here were also almost lost. However, Axel’s son Daniel, who was doing his final project at the HFG design school in Offenbach, scanned part of his father’s slide archives and gave them the title “Continental Breakfast.” Only these scans and around one hundred original slides have survived. His project made this book and the exhibition about the unusual life of his flying parents possible.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/c_u1_herrmann_700-1.jpg,https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Herrmann_1_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Herrmann_2_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Herrmann_3_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Herrmann_4_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Herrmann_5_720.jpg|https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Herrmann_6_720.jpg,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/axel-herrmann-continental-breakfast-en/
Osaka Diary,Peter Bialobrzeski,true,"Osaka Diary, August 17 – August 23, 2015
About the City Diaries
In his global, long-term project planned for 50 volumes (begun in 2013), Peter Bialobrzeski poses the question of whether the conception of the image of a city, shaped by prejudices, pre-existing notions, and media representations, can be translated into real images. He is interested in the cultural differences visible in each cityscape. He poses the question of what has already been superimposed by increasing globalization, or what remains visible. With his consistent, seemingly objectifying visual language, this epochal, documentary experiment can be wonderfully comprehended in each book and especially by comparing the individual books, e.g. for New York or Norderney.
Peter Bialobrzeski’s work has been exhibited worldwide. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including two World Press Photo Awards (2003, 2010). In 2012 he was granted the Dr. Erich Salomon Award by the German Photographic Society.",https://hartmann-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Osaka.jpg,,available,https://hartmann-books.com/en/produkt/peter-bialobrzeski-osaka-diary-2/
