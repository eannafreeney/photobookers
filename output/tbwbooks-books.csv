Not a Cookbook,Robby Reis,false,"Spiral-bound with flaps80 pages8 x 10 in. / 203.2 x 254 mm2025ISBN 978-1-942953-77-7
TBW Books is proud to announce the release of Not a Cookbook, the debut book by Canadian filmmaker and artist Robby Reis.
At first glance, Not a Cookbook appears to be just what its title implies—but beneath the surface lies a layered, collage-style portrait of a restaurant and the family that holds it together. Centered on Resto Palme, a Caribbean restaurant in Montreal run by married duo Lee-Anne Millaire Lafleur and Ralph Alerte, the book offers a deeply personal and provocative exploration of kitchen culture, where food becomes a lens through which to examine family, friendship, labor, and resistance.
A longtime friend of the family, Reis takes an embedded, nonlinear approach to storytelling. Through photographs, texts, and contributions from customers and staff, Not a Cookbook captures not just the daily challenges of running a family business, but also the peripheral stories—of racism, activism, and the emotional labor required to build and protect something shared and sacred.
Despite its name, Not a Cookbook does offer some treasured family recipes—however, when it comes to a few key ingredients that make a certain sauce so special, Alerte leaves us simply with, “sorry blood, I can’t give it away.” The result is a new model for the cookbook: a radical kitchen guide rooted in community, resilience, and love. Less about what’s on the plate, and more about everything that makes the plate possible.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_8-251661.jpg?v=1755893246,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_8-251539.jpg?v=1755893307|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_8-251559.jpg?v=1755890823|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_8-251560.jpg?v=1755890881|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/nac4.gif?v=1756037847|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_8-251565.jpg?v=1755890823|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_8-251544.jpg?v=1755890919,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/not-a-cookbook-1
"44 Irving Street, 1970–1971",Susan Meiselas,false,"Saddle-stitched softcover with flaps and two tipped-in chromogenic prints66 pages, 46 plates8.5 x 11 in / 215.9 x 279.4 mm2025ISBN 978-1-942953-81-4
TBW Books is proud to announce the publication of 44 Irving Street, 1970–1971 by Susan Meiselas, published in collaboration with Higher Pictures on the occasion of Meiselas’s exhibition of the same name at the gallery. 
In 1970, while a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Susan Meiselas was living in a boarding house at 44 Irving Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. What began as a class project evolved into a deeply empathetic portrait of community domestic life. Meiselas photographed her neighbors in the building—many of them strangers—inside their rooms, initiating a collaborative exchange by sharing contact sheets and inviting written responses. These reflections appear alongside the photographs, offering insight into how her subjects saw themselves. 
Boarding houses like 44 Irving Street were transitional spaces, yet Meiselas found individuality and self-expression in each room. Her portraits—full of personal detail and visual texture—reveal a rich inner life often hidden in shared housing. The handwritten letters act as a kind of written punctum, a counterpoint to the image that pierces the surface with honesty and introspection. 
This early body of work helped shape Meiselas’s enduring approach to photography as a form of connection and dialogue. “It wasn’t about the formalism of photography,” she notes. “It was about the narrative and the connectivity.” 
44 Irving Street, 1970–1971 marks the first time this complete series has been published in book form. The book includes two tip-ins: a photograph and a contact sheet from the original project.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_7-22-250905.jpg?v=1753905746,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_7-22-250835.jpg?v=1753905505|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_7-22-250908.jpg?v=1753905750|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_7-22-250842.jpg?v=1753905510|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_7-22-250841.jpg?v=1753905509|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_7-22-250847.jpg?v=1753905518|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_7-22-250911.jpg?v=1754421840,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/44-irving-street-1970-1971
The Marble,David Brandon Geeting,false,"Casebound hardcover with tip-in180 pages, 144 color plates8.5 x 11 in / 215.9 x 279.4 mmForeword by Caroline Polachek2025ISBN 978-1-942953-80-7
TBW Books is pleased to announce the publication of The Marble by artist David Brandon Geeting.
In The Marble, Geeting pushes photography to the edge of absurdity and back again. Working at the intersection of commercial gloss and fashion fantasy, stock image neutrality, and the strangeness of amateur imagemaking, Geeting builds a visual language that is both highly polished and deeply confounding in its narrative. The result is a book as humorous as it is heartfelt—an offering of staged sincerity wrapped in surreal detail.
Geeting’s career began in 2012, shortly after graduating from the School of Visual Arts in 2011. While working at a juice bar, he photographed in his spare time and posted images to Tumblr, where his distinctive approach quickly drew attention and led him into commercial and fashion photography. His art practice would continue to build from these worlds and blur the lines between image distinctions—an approach that carries through into The Marble, where the tension between chaos and control is rendered playful and alive, everyday objects become characters, emotions are suggested through color and texture, and narrative logic gives way to visual rhythm.
At its most intimate, the book flirts with existentialism; at its most extreme, it may be the first photo book to seriously consider the perspective of an ant.
The book opens with a foreword by musician and artist Caroline Polachek, whose own work shares Geeting’s fascination with surface, sensation, and the eroding distinction between fact and fiction that defines the current moment. Ultimately, The Marble asks its viewers: What happens when photography lets go of itself—and its ego? The result is something weirdly and beautifully tender.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_8-251914.jpg?v=1755894635,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_8-251695.jpg?v=1755895501|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_8-251746.jpg?v=1756922793|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_8-251726.jpg?v=1756922972|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_8-251797.jpg?v=1756922988|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_8-251701.jpg?v=1755895494|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_8-251714.jpg?v=1755895788,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/the-marble
Lost Coast (Second Edition),Curran Hatleberg,false,"Hardbound foil-embossed cloth with tip on100 pages, 47 full color plates8.27 x 9.72 in. / 210 x 247 mm2025ISBN 978-1-942953-75-3
TBW Books is proud to announce the long-awaited reprint of Lost Coast, the debut monograph by Curran Hatleberg. First published in 2016 and out of print for nearly a decade, Lost Coast has become one of the most sought-after titles in contemporary photography—rarely, if ever, seen on the secondary market. This new edition, faithful in every way to the original sequence and edit, features vastly improved production: newly remastered files, elevated print quality, richer color reproduction, and upgraded materials, all executed with the precision and care that have come to define Hatleberg’s work.
In Lost Coast, Hatleberg presents an episodic narrative centered on Eureka, California. The photographs move fluidly between intimate portraits and the surrounding landscape, between moments of shared connection and quiet dislocation. Each image feels like a short story, rich with detail and ambiguity—offering a layered portrait of a place shaped equally by natural grandeur and the slow erosion of economic promise.
The book’s title references the remote stretch of California’s northern coast, but also gestures to a deeper sense of disappearance—of lives lived in the margins, of dreams cast aside, of overlooked beauty. 
Lost Coast marked the beginning of Hatleberg’s acclaimed photographic practice exploring contemporary American life. This reprint reintroduces that start with greater clarity and presence than ever before.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_9-22-2517288.jpg?v=1760647111,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_9-22-2517127.jpg?v=1760647110|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_9-22-2517286.jpg?v=1760647109|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_9-22-2517173.jpg?v=1760647109|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_9-22-2517187.jpg?v=1760647108|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_9-22-2517158.jpg?v=1760647109|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_9-22-2517282.jpg?v=1760647111,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/lost-coast-1
Posthume,Mark Armijo McKnight,false,"Hardcover with handmade paper housed in a box36 pages, 14 tip-on plates14.25 x 18.75 in. / 362 x 476.25 mmEdition of 750, each signed and numbered2025ISBN 978-1-942953-74-6
TBW Books is pleased to announce the publication of Posthume, a new monograph by Mark Armijo McKnight.
Comprising fourteen photographs—each reproduced as 8 × 10-inch meticulously tri-tone printed, hand-tipped plates—Posthume is a quiet, contemplative body of work. Oversized in format and restrained in scope, the book is both elegy and invocation: a memento mori that gestures towards the old masters, Armijo McKnight’s queer identity, and his Mexican American heritage.
In these images, nude figures traverse or recline within stark landscapes, their faces obscured by skull masks. At once tender and unsettling, the photographs refuse easy interpretation: are these figures alive or dead? At peace or discarded? Their gestures suggest rest, ritual, mourning, and sensuality all at once. The ambiguity is not a riddle to be solved, but a space the artist holds open—for memory, desire, and transformation.
The work draws on the Western art historical tradition of the memento mori while also engaging the iconography and spiritual logic of Día de los Muertos, in which the dead are never fully gone. The skulls, then, are not only symbols of death, but masks of possibility—portals through which the living and the dead, the past and the present, the sacred and the erotic, might meet.
The book is housed in a box made from humble, utilitarian materials. It is wrapped in a custom paper created in collaboration with artisan papermakers in Oaxaca, made from native agave fibers and embedded with dried petals of the cempasúchil flower, traditionally used in Día de los Muertos altars. The gesture is tactile and symbolic: a shroud, an offering, a return to the Earth.
Published in an oversized edition of 750, each copy of Posthume is signed by the artist.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_10-6-25_JSchaedel17833.jpg?v=1760641081,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_10-6-25_JSchaedel17835-2.jpg?v=1760650466|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_10-6-25_JSchaedel17756.jpg?v=1760649853|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_10-6-25_JSchaedel17766.jpg?v=1760650758|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_10-6-25_JSchaedel17791.jpg?v=1760643560|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_10-6-25_JSchaedel17797.jpg?v=1760641133|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_10-6-25_JSchaedel17824.jpg?v=1760641167,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/posthume
Swan Moon's Swan Moon,Swan Moon,false,"Casebound hardcover with tipped-in chromogenic print132 pages, 76 plates7.6 x 10.5 in. / 193 x 260 mmAfterword by Chris Kraus2025ISBN 978-1-942953-78-4
Swan Moon's Swan Moon is a diaristic portrait of youth, identity, and performance set against the faded glamour of 1990s Los Angeles. Swan Moon revisits her teenage years as a Korean American growing up in the cultural shadow of Hollywood—where cinema’s myths loomed large and personal history blurred with fantasy.
While alternative youth were raving and Larry Clark’s Kids was defining a generation, Moon and her friends were doing something profoundly divergent: dressing in vintage clothing, staging impromptu, cinematically adjacent environments, and living out an aesthetic that was wildly out of sync with the time. The work feels improvised, playful—shot with flea market props and makeshift lighting which carried with it an amateurish charm. Moon wasn’t imitating Cindy Sherman—she had yet to know that name let alone see the iconic Untitled Film Stills—but she was drawing directly from the language of cinema, attempting to insert herself and her circle within the medium’s canon.
The photographs echo mid-century domesticity—gestures borrowed from the 1950s and ’60s—but subverted through the awareness and often overwrought angst of the 1990s. Sexuality here is present but subdued, expressed with a tenderness that would soon be obliterated by the onset of the Internet's rise. There’s humor, style and an earnest make-believe that is refreshing in light of today’s hyper self-awareness and image saturation.
Designed with a nod to Hollywood's silver screen, Swan Moon’s Swan Moon includes a curated soundtrack and character credits at the book’s conclusion. An afterword by the esteemed writer Chris Kraus brings clarity and context to Moon’s love letter to a nostalgic Los Angeles—her version of the city and its youthful inhabitants that feels both deeply personal and entirely lost to time.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_9-22-2517290.jpg?v=1760646203,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_9-22-2516974.jpg?v=1760646275|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_9-22-2516976.jpg?v=1760646275|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_9-22-2517297.jpg?v=1760648388|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_9-22-2516978.jpg?v=1760646314|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_9-22-2516981.jpg?v=1760648582|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_9-22-2516995.jpg?v=1760648524,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/swan-moons-swan-moon
Blood Green,Curran Hatleberg,false,"Hardbound with edge color64 pages, 35 plates11.5 x 13.5 in. / 292 x 343 mmEdition of 1,000 signed copies2025ISBN 978-1-942953-76-0
TBW Books is pleased to announce Blood Green, a new artist book by Curran Hatleberg, conceived as a coda to the artist’s acclaimed 2022 monograph, River’s Dream. Blood Green offers an alternate vision—less an outtake than a parallel dream, a shadow of the original, expanding on the darker themes of contemporary American life.
Continuing his journey through the American Southeast, Hatleberg travels further downriver and deeper into its swamplands. These new images are dense and disorienting. In thickets and backwaters, animals appear only to vanish, while violence is ever-present in the human need to contain what ultimately cannot be tamed.
This haunting dialogue continues the conversations between nature and civilization, and between beauty and mortality, that Hatleberg adeptly began in River’s Dream. As always, Hatleberg’s frame carries a rare sensitivity, built not from observation alone but from time shared—both with the landscape and with those befriended along the way.
Printed with the same precision, exactitude and dimensions as River’s Dream, Blood Green is limited to 1,000 copies, each signed by the artist. The book is printed in both full color and duotone, offering an intimate reconciliation to Hatleberg’s evolving American portrait.

Double Player,Peter Tomka,false,"Casebound hardcover112 pages, 50 plates10 x 13 in / 254 x 330 mmEdition of 5002025ISBN 978-1-942953-82-1
TBW Books is proud to present Double Player, an unconventional photographic book form by Peter Tomka that demands to be experienced by two people. This work unfolds and folds back into itself—a Möbius loop of imagery, or perhaps an ouroboros: an endless cycle of visual connections shared in real time between both viewers.
Loosely inspired by the structure of a deck of playing cards, Double Player weaves together five distinct bodies of work—Bachelor Suite (2024), Heatwave Suite (2024), Watering Hole (2023), Three Works (2021), and Paternity Test (2021)—shuffled into a whole that reveals surprising connections and throughlines. The book strikingly opens with the word GAYLORD—in another context, the name of a legendary Los Angeles apartment complex, but here, a directive that sets the tone and calls the viewer to engage immediately with the ensuing images.
The photographs are either created by the artist in a performative manner or appropriated from cinema, television, and pop culture, past and present. The circulation and repetition of motifs invite collaboration and reflection, emphasizing the act of shared viewing as part of the work’s meaning. The book collides ( both literally and metaphorically) at the halfway point, designed to be exactly the same from front to back—revealing no beginning or end, but rather an infinite loop that can be entered from any point.
Double Player is published on the occasion of Peter Tomka’s inclusion in Made in L.A. at the Hammer Museum, and marks the artist’s first monograph.

Asunder,S. Billie Mandle,false,"Saddle stitched softcover80 pages, 54 color plates10 x 13.25 in / 254 x 337 mm2025ISBN 978-1-942953-79-1
S. Billie Mandle’s Asunder is an immersive and disquieting photographic meditation on attention, contradiction, and the quiet entanglement of beauty and destruction.
Devoid of external text or identifiers, the book arrives almost mute echoing the slow, flickering reveal within.
Three years in the making, Asunder began in the aftermath of the 2020 Glass Fire in Northern California—one in a series of increasingly catastrophic wildfires reshaping the region’s landscape and psyche.
Printed in dark, velvety tones on unbleached, pulpy paper—a tactile reminder of the fragility and material history of trees—the book opens with a glowing orb gradually overtaking the frame across thirteen pages. This visual prologue sets a foreboding, otherworldly tone. A quote from Dante’s Inferno marks the descent: “...the pathway had been lost.”
What follows might resemble a walk through the forest, but it unfolds more like a stumble. Mandle’s images don’t lead the viewer through a landscape—they pause, hesitate, and invite waiting. At first glance, the scenes may appear quiet or familiar, but subtle disruptions surface: scorched trunks, brittle branches, the dense residue of loss. The sequence shifts from light to dark, drawing the viewer into a looping, claustrophobic narrative.
The forest here is both dead and alive. The trees remain, altered but upright. This coexistence of devastation and persistence is at the heart of Asunder—a paradox where beauty and ruin are not opposites, but facets of the same truth. The result is a patient, unsettling portrait of aftermath—where the act of looking becomes an acknowledgment of what endures.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_11-22-2520182.jpg?v=1768330278,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_11-22-2520185.jpg?v=1768330494|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_11-22-2520187.jpg?v=1768330271|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_11-22-2520200.jpg?v=1768330352|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_11-22-2520205.jpg?v=1768330372|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_11-22-2520206.jpg?v=1768330383|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_11-22-2520209.jpg?v=1768330394,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/asunder
The Last Things,John Lehr,false,"Casebound hardcover with French fold jacket122 pages, 80 color plates10.5 x 12.6 in. / 267 x 320 mm2024ISBN 978-1-942953-65-4




The Last Things explores the artifacts of an American archeological present. The work in this series depicts vernacular forms of architecture, signage, images, and objects that were hastily made in a rush for attention, or abandoned in place after their usefulness had expired. Lehr posits them as symptomatic symbols of the repetitive cycles of decline, rehabilitation, violence, and mourning that are woven into the fabric of contemporary American life.

These light-drenched photographs vividly describe a nation speaking through the language of capitalism. Words and images repeat and contradict throughout the work, reflecting emphatic pleas and shifting priorities. At other times, language breaks down completely, giving way to pictographic forms that are both primitive and utterly contemporary. Flaking paint morphs into JPEG vinyl printouts and LED displays, blurring the line between commercial speech and individual expression.

Embedded in the work is a belief in the power and absurdity of objects that—like a body—bear the traces of collective experience. In its distilled and emphatic sequencing The Last Things reads as a prose poem and a cryptic cipher about a country at the brink of a tipping point.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/1-2.jpg?v=1730911932,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/2-2-2.jpg?v=1730911963|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/3-2-2.jpg?v=1730911965|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/4-2-2.jpg?v=1730911967|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/5-2-2.jpg?v=1730911965|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/6-2-2.jpg?v=1730911963|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/7-2-2.jpg?v=1730911965,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/the-last-things
Californian Wildflowers,Pieter Hugo,false,"Softcover with French fold dust jacket

In 2014 and 2015, Pieter Hugo met the subjects of his photographs in San Francisco’s Tenderloin and Los Angeles’s Skid Row districts. The high-key lighting of the relentless California sun characterizes these outdoor portraits made in the city streets. Bold colors and chiaroscuro form the language used by Hugo to complement the expansive gestures and curving forms of his subjects—wild and unrestrained. Hugo pairs this theme of abandonment with a style that invokes Dutch Golden Age or Baroque master painters such as Caravaggio or Frans Hals. The intensity of attention similarly brought to these sitters in their engagement with Hugo is palpable. The resulting photographs—so completely steeped in a careful handling of shape, form, color, and light—transcend beyond their specific moment in time to embody an overarching timelessness. Too frequently overlooked, Hugo brings our attention to these wildflowers blooming from the uncommon Californian land and its elusive promise of prosperity. Uninhibited and lawless, we bear witness to a truth that only they are capable of transmitting.

Nicotine,TR Ericsson,false,"Screw post-bound hardcover folio50 pages, 26 color plates, hand-tipped10 x 13 in / 254 x 330 mmSigned, numbered and burned
2024ISBN 978-1-942953-71-5

Multimedia artist TR Ericsson reimagines personal family photographs in his deeply moving book, Nicotine. To create the artworks, Ericsson employs a unique process that involves passing nicotine through a halftone silkscreen, resulting in a ghostly imprint of an image. The resulting prints are as much about the haunting presence of the past manifested in photographs as they are about memory’s ephemeral nature.
A lifelong smoker, Ericsson’s mother, Sue, would often stay up late into the night at her dining table, cigarette in hand. After her death by suicide in 2003, Ericsson was faced with the task of cleaning her home and its nicotine-stained walls. This experience served as the catalyst for the creation of the nicotine works. As Ericsson scraped the wallpaper, he thought not just of the physical stains but of his mother herself—alone, up all night, ruminating over her past.
Nicotine is an ode to the life of Ericsson’s mother and a meditation on the lingering impressions that remain when a life ends. In transforming seemingly banal snapshots into newly conceived forms, Ericsson recontextualizes the images, elevates them, and preserves the newfound narratives that they carry—stories that would otherwise be buried with the deceased.
Nicotine takes the form of a strange and eccentric family album. Its cover is bound in a luxurious tobacco-colored, suede-like cloth that evokes the drapery of interiors from another time. It is a physical memorial that captures the fading essence of a life once lived. With echoes of a nineteenth-century scientific catalog, each of the twenty-six images are individually tipped on the book's pages, referencing the meticulous attention given to a family scrapbook.
The process of burning these images into existence using the same chemicals that contributed to his mother’s deteriorating health transforms the book into a sacred vessel invoking a seance, an altarpiece, and a ritualistic act of remembering. The tones of the nicotine-stained prints vary, reminding us that each print is an act of performance and a unique, physical record of time. Here the fugitive print qualities of photographs are inverted—rather than fade away, the image materializes, rising from the ashes to be remembered.
Printed in a limited edition of 500 copies, each book is hand-numbered, signed, and features a final personal touch—each is burned with a lit cigarette, making every book a singular tribute to the ephemerality of life.

What the Rain Might Bring,Dylan Hausthor,false,"Casebound flexicover with printed edges and spine144 pages (with 7 gatefolds), 72 duotone plates8 x 10 in / 203 x 254 mm2024ISBN 978-1-942953-66-1
 
TBW Books presents What the Rain Might Bring, the debut release from photographer Dylan Hausthor. Designed as a work of art in its own right, the book features a frame—black edge and spine printing—and is completely devoid of text with only a simple title on its cover. The minimalist design sets the stage for an immersive sensory experience that intertwines the tactile and the visual, drawing readers into a world steeped in mysticism.
 
Inspired by David Arora’s mushroom identification guide, Hausthor’s large-format black-and-white photographs explore the rich interplay between human, plant, and animal realms. What the Rain Might Bring delves into themes of storytelling, faith, folklore, and the inherent queerness of nature. The images evoke a sense of pagan, Wiccan, religious, anarchic, and mystic rituals, offering a visual exploration that is at once candid and full of hidden secrets.
 
Within Hausthor’s untamed world, characters and landscapes become conduits, weaving together new narratives that challenge perceptions of reality. The imagery—an owl mid-flight, a procession of figures, an infant nursing at its mother’s breast, a towering mushroom, and spiders in their webs—paints a world where human roles feel fragile, overshadowed by the dominance of nature. Each photograph oscillates between the eerie and enchanting, the humorous and the haunting.
 
Central to Hausthor’s work is a fascination with the instability of fact in storytelling. The viewer is drawn into a space where the line between truth and artistic license is deliberately blurred. Hausthor’s photography integrates elements of ad hoc investigative journalism, disinformation, and performance, disrupting traditional approaches to nature photography. The result is an exploration of a post-fact world, where the boundaries between parable and reality dissolve, leaving the viewer to question what they believe.
 
The book’s structure is anchored by seven delicate gatefolds, symbolizing the consecutive nights Hausthor was visited by a moth—an intimate marker of times that lends the work a diaristic quality. These pages invite readers into a ritualistic experience, transforming the book into a meditative artifact that reflects the fractured, fluid, and deeply human nature of reality itself.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/1_8bcc2714-3474-45b4-b43f-2f66f59fd96e.jpg?v=1730298410,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/2_9481ce69-53fa-4c17-bf69-51b0eb6de787.jpg?v=1730298438|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/3_a50a0689-b5d2-4aff-864f-6054a4888ed5.jpg?v=1730298438|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/4_c6c26fae-4021-4abe-b451-5e953a1099c0.jpg?v=1730298438|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/5_b1671e71-2622-45db-a8cd-afc8f0662196.jpg?v=1730298437|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/6_be68439a-e087-4441-a397-cd315c048ac5.jpg?v=1730298438|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/7_145734f4-063b-4e4e-afde-021de42b4772.jpg?v=1730298437,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/what-the-rain-might-bring
A Season Particular,Shen Wei,false,"Casebound with tip-on112 pages, 88 color plates6.75 x 10 in. / 171 x 254 mm2024ISBN 978-1-942953-70-8
In A Season Particular, Shen Wei invites us into a world where intimacy and spontaneity collide, yielding a series of photographic encounters that are as raw as they are tender. The artist’s work is a delicate and visceral exploration of the human body, captured in soft, explicit close-ups that pulse with immediacy. These images, deliberately printed with a density that mirrors the subjects’ flesh, draw the viewer into a realm of evocative lust and fluidity. 
Wei’s approach is not merely about documentation but about immersion. The viewer is invited to participate rather than observe from a distance, breaking away from the traditional voyeuristic lens often associated with nudity in art. Here, the act of looking becomes an act of joining—of stepping into and participating in the space historically reserved for the artist and subject. The images ooze with a gentle sexuality, one that is unplanned and organic. This pure expression of sexuality transcends traditional binaries of heterosexual or homosexual orientation—moving into a variable expression of desire that resists categorization.
Interwoven with these human forms are Wei’s meditations on botanical subjects, creating a lyrical dialogue between different organic entities. These observations complement the flow of exchange, making the turning of the pages an act of inclusion for the viewer. 
The photographs are also a reflection of Wei’s Chinese identity, that is subtly woven into the fabric of this work. They challenge and reinterpret notions of desire, intimacy, and self-discovery, all against the backdrop of a cultural upbringing that prized restraint and conservatism. In A Season Particular, Shen Wei’s lens becomes a conduit for a new kind of expression, one that is as much about the relationships formed in the moment as it is about the images themselves.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/1_93fe350a-9251-4ba1-8d50-745d5386e7fd.jpg?v=1731090241,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/2_3ae2c967-012c-4f90-896a-0081804d235f.jpg?v=1731090240|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/3_fc417a00-7d1b-4f57-8c04-d9edf1e28f49.jpg?v=1731090240|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/4_3a2909c7-b061-4362-96a7-72be7b285a99.jpg?v=1731090241|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/5_1e73fe08-f1e1-4c3e-b3fc-b6ee1265f3db.jpg?v=1731090241|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/6_8e63fb1a-af35-4318-9bf6-cf9d4c6ebd0d.jpg?v=1731090240|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/7_c9d28600-8234-4c47-9337-6f42777a1129.jpg?v=1731090241,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/a-season-particular

Using the title of her 2004 photograph, My Mother, My Son, as an inspirational and creative starting point, Mary Frey pulls from her vast archive of photographs to create a pictorial story collapsing linear time. Frey intimately and masterfully captures subjects at ease in environments that feel, at once, wholly familiar yet unmoored from their own reality. Using as its base the intersection of the domestic, the banal and the profoundly common rituals which define our shared humanity, the black and white and color images in My Mother, My Son. present the viewer with something more reminiscent of memory’s elusive imprint. Frey touches upon the mystery of life: the finite ending point of death and the legacies that are left behind. Past and future join together in each present, fleeting moment. With a tipped-in chromogenic print on its cover, My Mother, My Son. stylistically echoes a family album both commemorative and permanent, if only in the story it chooses to present.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/W_GS_December23_TBW_11-25-2311119_edit2copy_b72621e2-fefa-4639-b2cc-bee9d8d05385.jpg?v=1707517366,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/W_GS_December23_TBW_11-25-2311124_edit2copy.jpg?v=1707517393|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/W_GS_December23_TBW_11-25-2311130_edit2copy.jpg?v=1707517422|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/W_GS_December23_TBW_11-25-2311131_edit2copy.jpg?v=1707517436|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/W_GS_December23_TBW_11-25-2311134_edit2copy_00308434-0175-4ec6-81df-c86b336a5b8b.jpg?v=1707517449|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/W_GS_December23_TBW_11-25-2311138_edit2copy.jpg?v=1707506143|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/W_GS_December23_TBW_11-25-2311149_edit2copy.jpg?v=1707506094,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/my-mother-my-son
Daily Self-Portraits 1972–1973,Melissa Shook,false,"Linen flexicover with French dust jacket400 pages, 198 duotone plates8 x 10 in. / 203 x 254 mmEssay by Sally Stein2024ISBN 978-1-942953-61-6
It was important to let my unconscious, rather than my intellect, dictate the progression. For reasons I don’t entirely understand, being nude became part of the project early on. And working against that white wall, near the two front windows in the so-called living room, became a central point.
— Melissa Shook
In December 1972, Melissa Shook (1939–2020) began a series of daily self-portraits in her Lower East Side apartment that she would continue until August 1973. Daily Self-Portraits 1972–1973 is the artist’s complete series of 192 photographs published together for the first time. With her medium format, black and white photographs, Shook captures herself in a variety of poses creating a more complete portrait than could be achieved with any one image. The photographs often include Shook’s daughter and the friends who populate her sphere. The viewer is introduced to the artist’s intimate domain and the mundanity of everyday existence comes to the forefront: nursing her ailing toe on the couch, sitting at the kitchen table with a friend, hair wrapped up in a towel post shower, dancing with her daughter. Rather than strictly embodying a typical vision of beauty, Shook’s poses are often imbued with irreverence and parody as a rejection of the tradition of female portraiture made from a male perspective. The book is astutely contextualized by Sally Stein's essay highlighting the artist’s purposeful dismissal of the idea of a single, revelatory moment, opting instead for the extended serial portrait, with all its contradictions and complexity.

There Is No Light at the End of the Tunnel Because the Tunnel Is Made of Light,Ryan Spencer,false,"Paperback with colored edges272 pages, 124 plates4.25 x 7 in. / 108 x 178 mmEssay by Rebecca BengalIllustrations by Chummy Alexanian2024ISBN 978-1-942953-63-0
In 1996, rock band The Afghan Whigs released their album Black Love, a musical opus that changed the lives of many of the group’s loyal followers. The well-known lore that a film would accompany the record never came to fruition, leaving devotees to wonder what such a visual accompaniment might have looked like. There Is No Light at the End of the Tunnel Because the Tunnel Is Made of Light is Ryan Spencer’s personal rendering of this mythical film (that never was) in book form. Using stills from neo-noir films set in Los Angeles that could quite possibly exist as scenes from the imagined moving picture, and with a keen understanding of and appreciation for photography and old cinema, the artist stitches together a narrative directed by the song titles and linear narratives of The Afghan Whigs’ epic record. Rebecca Bengal’s fictional essay anchors the book’s stylized, physical “pulp” qualities.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_2-15-240601copy.jpg?v=1708959547,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_2-15-240307copy.jpg?v=1708959597|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_2-15-240348copy.jpg?v=1708959664|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_2-15-240372copy.jpg?v=1708959637|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_2-15-240355copy.jpg?v=1708959655|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_2-15-240433copy.jpg?v=1708959644|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_2-15-240326copy.jpg?v=1708959649,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/there-is-no-light-in-the-tunnel-because-the-tunnel-is-made-of-light
Dead Ringer,Yael Eban and Matthew Gamber,false,"Softcover with exposed binding and dust jacket120 pages, 95 color plates9 x 12 in. / 229 x 305 mmEssay by Clément Chéroux2024ISBN 978-1-942953-64-7
In this digital world the tactility of the printed past becomes ever more intriguing. To consider where all these photos are, where they go, and what they mean is to tap into endless human histories, both big and small. Today there are almost too many images to process, make sense of, or to give proper attention. Even so, over the last one hundred plus years a wonderful trove has been left behind with which artists can create new worlds. Fetishizing and reevaluating vintage, vernacular photos has a well-trodden tradition. To find new insights and unique perspectives on the genre is rare. But even rarer is to find disparate images that have had separate journeys around the world only to reconvene back here in this collection. 
Working together for the past seven years, Yael Eban and Matthew Gamber have collected the pairs of vernacular photographs found in Dead Ringer in thrift stores, antique markets and on eBay. Either sold as pairs or found separately from different sources, the fruits of the artists’ search highlights the slight variations of the photographic prints and the individual history each has taken. The images’ origins might have begun identically but almost immediately the trajectory of their printed lives veered into distinctly separate directions. Who carried one of these sacred prints in their wallet or kept one framed beside their bed? All to be heaped into a pile of countless other photographs at an estate sale after their passing. Who are these lovers and companions? What are these cherished places? What occasions (momentous or banal) necessitated this documentation?

Sex. Death. Transcendence.,Linda Troeller,false,"Faux-velvet softcover with hand-sewn saddle stitch binding96 pages, 48 color / 11 duotone plates9 x 13 in. / 229 x 330 mmEssay by Darcey Steinke2024ISBN 978-1-942953-51-7
Over the years, I saw that the body must be examined, moved, re-engaged, re-found, re-addressed because it is such a powerful route to intimate photographs and a surreal contact with the great beyond.
— Linda Troeller
Linda Troeller uses the camera like a tool to activate her own personal shamanistic ritual. A producer of self-portraiture her entire life and now in her seventies, Troeller identifies the moment of making a photograph as one of deep realization, spiritual connection, and even transformation. Each self-image allows her a more complete understanding of her being. Sex. Death. Transcendence. joins together a selection of these self-portraits spanning her life—in black and white and color, with traditional film and iPhone cameras—that mark her existence in time. Troeller uses her own aging body and by doing so challenges our notions of what we deem desirable as a culture. Troeller flips her own image on the viewer along with all of its meaning and power and forces us to take a deeper look within ourselves. Darcey Steinke’s insightful essay contextualizes Troeller’s individualistic approach to photography.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/W_GS_December23_TBW_11-25-2311028_edit2copy.jpg?v=1707504947,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/W_GS_December23_TBW_11-25-2311069_edit2copy.jpg?v=1707504980|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/W_GS_December23_TBW_11-25-2311059_edit2copy.jpg?v=1707505103|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/W_GS_December23_TBW_11-25-2311088_edit2copy.jpg?v=1707505119|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/W_GS_December23_TBW_11-25-2311071_edit2copy.jpg?v=1707505139|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/W_GS_December23_TBW_11-25-2311039_edit2copy.jpg?v=1707505191|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/W_GS_December23_TBW_11-25-2311096_edit2copy.jpg?v=1707505202,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/sex-death-transcendence

TBW Books is pleased to present Tender, the first monograph by artist Carla Williams. Made in private between 1984 and 1999 and kept mostly to herself for more than thirty years, the images in Tender comprise a complete, personal self-portrait of a young, queer, Black woman intimately exploring the realm of her own possibility. When Williams was eighteen and studying photography at Princeton, she began making the black and white and color portraits in Tender to create pictures in her own image. Her mind was filled equally with the canonical images of the medium’s male-driven history and the posing women discovered during her youth in her father’s pornography collection. Using her own body, Williams created the portraits she had never seen before. Made with instant Polaroid 35mm and 4x5 type 55 film formats, Williams profited from the near instant result to continuously play with her own expression and form. An act of tender commune with herself, these are every version of the artist on full display: provocative, playful, sensual, gentle, powerful, mean, glamorous, forlorn, funny. The photographs in Tender are ignited with the raw energy of a young artist on the cusp of adulthood and her own burgeoning sexual identity. Included in the book are essays by the artist and scholar Dr. Mireille Miller-Young.Winner of the 2023 Paris Photo – Aperture Foundation First PhotoBook Award",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_6-20-219957_d06a067c-24cd-4aca-b428-c8287126ff02.webp?v=1728411337,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_6-20-219995.webp?v=1728411341|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_6-20-2110016.webp?v=1728411342|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_6-20-219965_ea609a0e-ddbd-4083-a085-5942becba339.webp?v=1728411341|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_6-20-2110010.webp?v=1728411341|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_6-20-2110001.webp?v=1728411342,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/tender-second-edition
42nd and Vanderbilt (Second Edition),Peter Funch,false,"Softcover with tip-ons180 pages,131 color plates7.7 x 9.8 in / 195 x 250 mmAfterword by Douglas Coupland
2024ISBN 978-1-942953-73-9

Between 8:30 am and 9:30 am, from 2007 to 2016, at the southern corner of 42nd Street and Vanderbilt Avenue in New York City

Danish photographer, Peter Funch, placed these rigid confines upon his nine year photographic project, 42nd and Vanderbilt. Narrowing the infinite opportunities N.Y.C. has to offer an artist, Funch brings to the surface the minutiae contained within a fragment of our daily routine, the short walk from point A to point B, reminding us that the practice of photography in general, and street photography specifically, has only scratched the surface of possibility. Through categorical editing, equal parts intuitive and scientific, human patterning and mannerisms normally passed over on first read, become meditations on time, mortality, public and private space, the economy, and our inner selves. Funch employs a method that novelist and visual artist Douglas Coupland aptly describes in the book's afterword as ""a kinder, gentler kind of surveillance.""

In one example, what appears to be a diptych of a woman with images taken only seconds apart, slowly becomes a “Spot the Difference” puzzle: subtle variations in attire, hair, light and shadow emerge as we the viewer realize, in both wonder and consternation, that the images were in fact taken days, months, or perhaps even years apart.

This simple and effective mechanism employed by Funch permeates the ordinary with the extraordinary. The fact that our own unknown tendencies, together with the rhythms and denizens of our surrounding ecosystem, can endure and replay over a path traveled thousands of times, becoming akin to performance, is nothing short of a revelation.

This new softcover edition features four new subjects in addition to the originally published images.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/1_931af9dd-9c9a-4b26-bd18-3d274a3955b9.jpg?v=1730317081,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/2_45a60ad2-c99e-4f54-b5df-cc49134d937d.jpg?v=1730317081|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/3_1020fbda-9a14-4cab-ad51-fe380855443a.jpg?v=1730317081|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/4_3b303f66-58a6-42ca-9622-796c4f451948.jpg?v=1730317081|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/5_eb7479c7-863e-4b4c-bebb-54852788c969.jpg?v=1730317081|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/6_fda3c8f9-05b2-4540-9c27-174afa273d43.jpg?v=1730317081|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/7_659af6f6-3214-4ea5-85d2-bda9527c4d39.jpg?v=1730317081,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/42nd-and-vanderbilt-second-edition

2023ISBN 978-1-942953-60-9TBW Books is pleased to present Men Untitled by Carolyn Drake, a new series of photographs exploring her relationship to myths of masculinity in American culture.Following Knit Club (2012–2020), a subversive work about a community of women in rural Mississippi, Drake shifts her gaze in Men Untitled. In contrast to her previous work, her subjects are uprooted from their geographies. Erasing nearly all signs of place, Drake invites the viewer to look directly at the male bodies in front of her camera.The subjects in Men Untitled appear nude or half-dressed, frozen in awkward poses, torsos twisted and bent, backward facing, wearing furniture, and even hung upside down. But they also appear to be at ease with—possibly even acting in collusion with—the artist.Still-lives punctuate the portraits: an anatomical model of male genitalia perches on a velvet chair, a charred board of nails stands erect, and a formidable snake wraps itself around an empty window frame.Playful on its surface, the work’s underlying levity is brought to the fore in Drake’s epilogue, which recounts a sequence of personal experiences that motivated the work.Carolyn Drake was awarded the 2021 HCB Award by the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson to produce this series of photographs. With a row of embossed white faces tipped on the cover, each book is signed by the artist.Printed in a limited edition of 1,500 copies.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_6-20-2110101.jpg?v=1694644999,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_6-20-2110106.jpg?v=1694645080|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_6-20-2110113.jpg?v=1694645049|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_6-20-2110105.jpg?v=1694645105|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_6-20-2110111.jpg?v=1694645128|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_6-20-2110123.jpg?v=1694645157|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_6-20-2110094.jpg?v=1694645193,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/men-untitled

TBW Books is pleased to present A Sudden Gust of Wind (after Hokusai) by Jeff Wall. The original, a transparency in a light box that is part of the permanent collection at Tate Modern, is not simply a photograph, and similarly this scale reproduction is not simply a book. Nearly a decade in the making, this collaboration between the artist and publisher responds to the challenge of how Wall's work, characterized by its synthesis of materiality and scale, could be rendered uniquely into book form.
TBW Books' A Sudden Gust of Wind (after Hokusai) reproduces the image, printed from the artist's original digital montage file, on 98 unbound lightweight sheets of paper. Once installed, the sheets' gentle movements, created by localized airflow, echo the fly-away energy of the papers in the original picture. This version of the work creates a new relationship between the image and the atmosphere that it has become renowned for evoking.With tremendous attention to printing, design, and quality of materials, this edition of only 300 copies is a conceptual achievement guided by the highest standards of bookmaking.

TBW Books is pleased to announce the publication of Painting Photographs, a new book by Creative Growth Art Center artist Alice Wong. Wong's bold interpretation of vintage vernacular photographs breathes new life into family album kitsch and cliché shots of plants and landscapes, transforming them into a hyper-color plane of vivid abstraction. Using paint markers to enhance and obscure the formal qualities of appropriated imagery, Wong's hand brings energy to each underlying image, recalibrating the viewer's eye and sparking appreciation for otherwise still compositions. With fluid mark-making and a striking approach to color-blocking, Wong's craft merges with the photographic process to create work that feels at once of times past and completely contemporary.
Creative Growth Art Center is the oldest and largest nonprofit art studio for artists with developmental disabilities in the United States. Since 1974, Creative Growth has played a significant role in increasing public interest in the artistic capabilities and achievements of people with disabilities, providing a professional studio environment for artistic development, gallery exhibition and representation.

TBW Books is pleased to present River’s Dream, the latest monograph by Curran Hatleberg and a complete realization of the series exhibited at the 2019 Whitney Biennial. 
Hatleberg is known for traveling America, guided by intuition, to create scenes of American life and landscape. Working collaboratively with the people he meets, he recounts intimate stories of family and community. Here, in the follow-up to his first monograph Lost Coast (TBW Books, 2016), Hatleberg centers his narrative on the dog days of summer. Sweltering heat, dripping humidity, lush vegetation, and screaming insects—River’s Dream is a pulsing and episodic hallucination of life lived outdoors. In these sixty-five photographs, we move through swamps and groves, front yards and junkyards, encountering moments of haunting mystery and beautiful impermanence. Heightened by formal repetition, echo, and refrain, everyday scenes take on surreal, allegorical qualities. In the end, Hatleberg leaves us with the impression of memory, where the past is never gone, but appears and reappears endlessly, as in the flickering of a dream.
This book includes new texts by Natasaha Trethewey and Joy Williams.

Windscreen,Phil Jung,false,"Casebound hardcover with tip-on56 pages, 26 color plates16 x 13 in. / 40.64 x 33 cm2022ISBN 978-1-942953-45-6
In Phil Jung’s first monograph, Windscreen, we are positioned to peer through the windows of American cars that have seen better days. Captured on city streets, existing in a space somewhere between public and private, these car interiors are often found decrepit and empty, however each one comes alive through its inanimate details, the idiosyncratic marks of past and present owners, revealing a series of portraits without subjects.

Items both mundane and peculiar—empty packs of Carlton cigarettes, the shattered frame of a digital Van Gogh, a Ouija board planchette—trace the outlines of lives lived but not seen.  Scum, frost, and dead insects, appearing like beautiful color field abstractions, at times prevent us from seeing inside, and then the sudden presence of a disembodied hand makes us wonder if we should be looking at all.
Shot on Kodak 4x5 sheet film and printed with stunning articulation, Jung’s work, in its powerful use of color and composition, stands as an achievement of photographic formalism. But most striking is Jung’s deft and poetic evocation of the American social landscape told through renderings of automotive decay.

Implementing stylistically distinct approaches, each book works to challenge the artist's own practice, making room for discovery within not only their own oeuvre but within the language of photography itself.  
 
While each book is thought of as a stand-alone title, an undeniable dialogue is shared between all four when presented together, allowing viewers to experience the collection as a singular photographic meditation.

 
Body Index by Carmen Winant
Body Index began a decade ago when Winant worked as a model for figure drawing classes and, as she explains, watched herself being watched from every angle. Affected by this moment in which the surveilled female body is transmuted into art, Winant began to collect and collage images of women posing—originally intended as anatomical reference photographs for artists—to explore how the female body is instrumentalized before the camera's gaze. In contextualizing these images anew, Winant locates and exposes a hidden rebellion within the posing bodies. Though originally rendered as blank learning instruments, Winant’s subjects reveal a self-possession, an upper hand, something errant. A range of other bodies appear atop these images—from lesbian separatists to massage therapists and beyond—melding into a single picture-plane that complicates the terms of gendered agency and stillness. Originally assembled as a modular piece separated into discrete panels containing hundreds of image cells, the images are here presented in a tightly curated selection, each figure holding a single page.
 
















 
 
 
The Nipple by Juergen Teller
In The Nipple the viewer is immediately confronted by the book's cover of Teller’s mask-wearing nude subject. The image, notably shot pre-pandemic, acts as an allusion to the ever precarious nature of our mortal bodies. In his iconically casual style, Teller continues to allude to the body by pointing us to unused and uncared for exercise equipment on empty European city streets. Eventually this repetition is punctuated by a personal element, the artist himself undergoing an endoscopic medical procedure, perhaps routine but possibly more serious. When not isolating the human body itself, he gives us devastated proxies for it: an unworn dinosaur costume inert and wrinkled on the floor, a desiccated frog that’s fallen victim to roadkill, a lifeless fish on dirty ground many days since its last gasp. By contrasting images of weakness and desolation with those of bodily vitality, Teller foreshadows brilliantly the isolation and tension that, at the time of printing, were still yet to come.
 
















 
 
Study by Mona Kuhn
For Study, Mona Kuhn returns to the darkroom for the very reason she fell in love with photography: the latent image. Inspired by the surrealist photographers of the 1920’s, she explores the ethereal quality of solarization. A visually distinct process­ through which the photographed subject seems underlined by the alchemist’s pencil, solarization is thought to be discovered by Lee Miller while printing for Man Ray, who ultimately took credit for the discovery. The method is as complex and uncertain as the human form itself; consequently the recipes from the past no longer work on present-day materials. Like the figure in her images, Kuhn sought to find her own balance, the results culminating in a series of unique prints that reveal layers of silver glow in the form of oxidized magic.
Kuhn’s experiments in crystallizing the latent image mirror the Kafkaesque existence of her subject. From a vulnerable and inquisitive sense of self to the confident posture of a man addressing the invisible masses, the perfectly contained to dematerialized silhouettes, the photographs emphasize an absurd nuance, teetering on the edge of reality and surreality.
 
















 
 
 
Business of Fashion by Paul Kooiker
Business of Fashion was created in 2018 when photographer Paul Kooiker was invited by Michéle Lamy to do an art performance during Voices, an annual invitation-only event organized by the Business of Fashion (BOF) that gathers some of the most influential tastemakers of the global fashion industry, uniting them with innovators and entrepreneurs who together hold great influence on popular culture.
 Kooiker’s response to Lamy’s request was to photograph the guests one by one, equalizing them by capturing each from the neck down in a uniform “limbs-splayed” pose. Shot against a blank grayscale backdrop, the subjects, often accustomed to public recognition, become semi-anonymous, headless mannequins reminiscent of the window displays, mail order catalogues, and online marketplaces that drive the industry forward.  Balancing a voyeuristic intrigue with tongue-in-cheek humor, the photographs reveal to the viewer the often banal clothing of those who are anything but.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/Winant-07_for_website_2048x2048.jpg?v=1616536342,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/Winant-11_for_website_2048x2048.jpg?v=1616536384|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/Winant-12_for_website_2048x2048.jpg?v=1616536423|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/Winant-26_for_website_2048x2048.jpg?v=1616536456|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/Teller-06_for_website_2048x2048.jpg?v=1616536008|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/Teller-08_for_website_2048x2048.jpg?v=1616536046|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/Teller-10_for_website_2048x2048.jpg?v=1616536107,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/annual-series-no-7-four-book-set
Derby,Ken Graves and Eva Lipman,false,"Hardcover with dust jacket60 pages, 28 duotone plates9.25 x 10.5 inches / 235 x 267 mm2021ISBN 978-1-942953-47-0
Demolition derbies are spectacular celebrations of car culture, carnival culture, and a maximalist desire to be loud and destructive, all because… well, why not?  They’re chaotic, a ritualized nihilism of automotive destruction, metal and mud everywhere, but in Ken Graves and Eva Lipman’s Derby, an understated poetry emerges from the scene. There is not a collision to be found; instead the couple focuses on the nuanced moments that surround the event, crafting images that are equally anthropological and expressive, yet surprisingly quiet and kind, revealing the inexplicable beauty of a community in complete control of its own entertainment.
As viewers, we become privy to an endless cycle of wreckage and repair. Before an event, amateur mechanics make ad hoc repairs with full knowledge that their hard work will be undone in half the time. Sisyphean to a T. Chicken wire replaces windshields and gangly teenagers gut the interior of someone’s former dream car, which they likely bought the day before for the price of an old lawn mower. The cars are merely something to use and abuse, and possibly provide some laughs along the way. Hell, you might even break a rib or two.
For more than three decades Ken Graves and Eva Lipman were partners in both life and art. Always shooting as a singular entity, they blurred the lines of authorship and shared equal artistic credit for their images.

The stretch between Tijuana and San Diego is long. Very long. And it is as treacherous as it is beautiful. It is unlikely that anybody who has ever crossed it will easily forget it. Its desert like landscape is bound to carve itself equally onto body and soul.
—José Ángel Navejas 
Between 1983 and 1987 along the California / Mexico border, Ken Light took his Hasselblad camera and flash and rode along with US Border Patrol agents in the middle of the night as they combed the Otay Mesa looking for “illegal aliens.” He was there when they were apprehended – captured by authorities as well as the photographer’s flash. The black and white images are stark, impromptu mug shots in the desert, taken at a moment of extreme vulnerability, when hope gave way to despair, migrants caught in a cruel game of hide and seek.
Light’s photographs and José Ángel Navejas’ first hand, compelling memoir, presented in both English and Spanish, offer testimony of the harrowing night border crossing of those desperately seeking a chance at a better life. A day after Navejas first crossed the US border from Mexico, he was caught and deported back onto the streets of Tijuana. Undeterred, he crawled back through a tunnel to San Diego, where he entered the United States forever.
In piercing words and in the dark of night, Midnight la Frontera’s immediacy underscores the struggle and defiance of those who make the perilous hike for days and weeks in search of the American Dream.

The Imperfect Atlas,Peter Funch,false,"Softcover with four color-printed PVC dust jacket144 pages, 70 plates plus index of sourced reference materials8.75 x 12.25 in. / 222 x 311 mmAfterword featuring William Pym in conversation with Peter Funch2019ISBN 978-1-942953-42-570
Peter Funch’s latest project addresses the passage of time and man’s continued and evolving effects on the environment. Appropriately, Funch explores the Anthropocene by employing a photographic technique invented at the height of the Industrial Revolution, that of RGB tri-color separations. 
Featuring images captured during Funch’s various trips through the Northern Cascade Mountain Range, the book is an imperfect recreation of landscapes and wilderness as depicted in the archive of vintage postcards and ephemera of the region the artist amassed throughout his travels.
Using maps and satellite imagery to locate the position where the postcard images were created, Funch recaptures the landscapes across three distinct exposures via red, green, and blue filters, transposed one on top of the other. 
As time collapses across the recreated landscapes, features and events are revealed or obscured by each successive filter, speaking to what Funch calls “our blindness to the consequences we are creating.” The Imperfect Atlas brings to light a dialogue on man’s severe and accelerated impact on nature, a solemn and mystifying visual archive of a wilderness the future may not behold.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW-Books-The-Imperfect-Atlas-Peter-Spreads-02_0158e3c2-0012-42f4-9160-8944e5e9e2c3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1572467630,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW-Books-The-Imperfect-Atlas-Peter-Spreads-03_8b8f8d00-69ac-45f0-b696-23e24c654369_1024x1024.jpg?v=1572467636|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW-Books-The-Imperfect-Atlas-Peter-Spreads-04_3f51e75b-6c27-4756-bf72-219eacc4eb81_1024x1024.jpg?v=1572467642|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW-Books-The-Imperfect-Atlas-Peter-Spreads-05_3d150f7d-04f4-4a74-b8dc-ca6eb62ab9ca_1024x1024.jpg?v=1572467647|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW-Books-The-Imperfect-Atlas-Peter-Spreads-06_68115a70-4cb5-434a-a9a2-3ca8e392b04d_1024x1024.jpg?v=1572467651|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW-Books-The-Imperfect-Atlas-Peter-Spreads-07_71388f05-f9eb-463c-a665-3dc1e1978377_1024x1024.jpg?v=1572467656|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW-Books-The-Imperfect-Atlas-Peter-Spreads-08_09226fe9-7ec8-4148-be27-f2f25e85efd4_1024x1024.jpg?v=1572467660,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/the-imperfect-atlas

Family. Car. Trouble. Three nouns. When doesn't trouble follow both family and car? A tender series of pictures: I fell in love with everybody. Especially the car.
— Sally Mann
 
With Family Car Trouble, Gus Powell plays with the form of the novel, both as material object and as narrative vehicle for expressing interior life. The work records and reckons with the arrival of children, the departure of a father, and the maintenance of a difficult 1992 Volvo 940 station wagon. 
A new classic of the Automotive Bereavement Parenting genre.
Gus Powell was born in New York City in 1974. His previous books include The Lonely Ones (J&L Books, 2015) and The Company of Strangers (J&L Books, 2003).
 
Reviews:
 
Powell tells a tale of life as it happens, poetically interwoven, stylistically cohesive. His pictures are close to the bone; there are no photographs of him, but he is, nevertheless, present throughout. 
— Elisabeth Biondi
 
I yearn for my driving days. 
— Maria Friedlander
 
Gus Powell photographs through and across the deep range of emotions that exist within the microcosm of family.  He does this in a subtle and honest way, reminding us of the big and small, the joyful and the painful, and the dark and light moments in life and in death.  The work transmits deep feeling for the challenges and magic of being between young children and older parents. 
— Elinor Carucci
 
2019 was a banner year for photo books. Dozens of publications impressed me with their creative horsepower. But the one that touched me the most, Gus Powell’s Family Car Trouble, is as modest, sturdy and lovable as the 1993 Volvo it features. 
— Alec Soth, photo-eye
 
Gus Powell’s masterful family photo novella. Beautiful, sad and bittersweet. Perfect. The Volvo cried, and I cried with it. 
— Christian Patterson, photo-eye
 
Gus Powell’s book is a delicate balance of extremes – motion and stillness, life and death, skin and steel – a young family, a dying father and the constant maintenance of a 1992 Volvo. The car provides the necessary comic metaphor from what otherwise would have been an oppressive narrative. Many photographers have tried to share their parental loss but few have succeeded. Family Car Trouble is regarded as “a new classic of the Automotive Bereavement Parenting genre. 
— Jeff Ladd, PhotoBookStore Magazine
 
Gus Powell’s new book Family Car Trouble is one of the most touching and thoughtful works I have seen in some time. It is a tribute to Powell’s mental fortitude that he was able to conceive of such a moving project at a time of such despair. While we grapple with the death of his father, Powell reminds us of the wonderment of life by turning his lens towards his two curious and energetic kids. The interweaving stories of life, death, and Gus’s unceasing car troubles reminds us all that in the face of tragedy—whether you are ready for it or not—life moves on or, in this case, hovers in the mechanic’s parking lot. Powell’s deeply personal story is accentuated by the scale, design, and sequence of the book; as usual, everything is keenly considered in a Gus Powell production.

The images in Driftless were made by photographer Jason Vaughn during a period of life that found him wandering for a year in a region of Wisconsin known colloquially as the Driftless Area, named for the rugged terrain formed by a lack of pre-Illinoian continental glacial ice flow (“drift”). Vaughn’s temporary home seemingly describes the landscape as much as its human inhabitants.
While living in a rented apartment off the Mississippi River, awaiting the birth of his second child, and at the beginning of a second life chapter following a tenuous bout with cancer, Vaughn attempted to establish community despite his status as temporary visitor. During this in-between state his daily walks not only nurtured his art practice but also allowed for moments of clarity and belonging to seep into that practice.
Continuing in this spirit of a shared yet transient experience, the final image edit was given to author and journalist Brad Zellar, to lend his own verbal meanderings to the images, embedding a dueling but complementary narrative to the book.
An otherwise charged photograph of birds mid-flight, no doubt bound for a warmer and more hospitable climate is subdued and balanced by the caption “hey, options.”
Amongst his words, casual, yet world weary, we find a sense of sophisticated levity, fostering feelings of the hope over despair.
While creating the images for Driftless, Vaughn intimates that living next to the river allowed him to contemplate the human experience in a new way and to meditate on “the process by which people can drift through a space, sometimes becoming lodged, sometimes becoming permanent, and sometimes breaking free and moving to a new location.”
As a duo, Vaughn and Zellar assist one another in weaving a narrative until their voices seem one.  Each fleeting moment adds a layer of meaning, transforming, over time, from a conversation to a shared story.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/Driftless_Spread_mock_01_2048_2048x2048.jpg?v=1537309848,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/Driftless_Spread_mock_11_2048_2048x2048.jpg?v=1537309658|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/Driftless_Spread_mock_08_2048_2048x2048.jpg?v=1537309675|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/Driftless_Spread_mock_07_2048_2048x2048.jpg?v=1537309682|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/Driftless_Spread_mock_02_2048_2048x2048.jpg?v=1537309715|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/Driftless_Spread_mock_06_2048_2048x2048.jpg?v=1537309687|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/Driftless_Spread_mock_05_2048_2048x2048.jpg?v=1537309696,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/driftless
A-B-Cheeeese!,Children's Book,false,"Hardcover56 pages, 26 four-color plates8 x 9 in. / 203 x 229 mmEdited by Paul and Sarah SchiekDesigned by Jason Munn2016ISBN 978-1-942953-23-4
 
A unique and wholly new way to approach the alphabet, A-B-Cheeeese! is a found-photo collection of children doing what children do best, smiling and laughing for the camera. Edited by husband and wife, Paul and Sarah Schiek, the photos challenge the usual ""A is for Apple"" fare in this nostalgic children's book. Here, C is for Curious, H is for Hello and P is for Piñata!
 
Curated to provoke conversation, A-B-Cheeeese! is as entertaining for kids as it is for parents reading alongside and explaining that the blue thing with a chord in ""H is for Hello"" is what a telephone used to look like. The book takes us on a journey to explore a bygone time when the people and objects in a photo held as much of an intriguing importance as the physical photographs themselves.

The eye of Jim Jocoy finds beauty in the wild. His photography is always in service to the magic of the devious iconoclast, exhibiting dignity to the outriders.
 
— Thurston Moore
 
 
Almost twenty years after the release of his first monograph, We’re Desperate, produced with the help of Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore and fashion designer Marc Jacobs and widely regarded as the definitive catalog of early West Coast punk fashion, Jim Jocoy’s archive of previously unseen photographs has been re-examined and re-considered to compose Order of Appearance, a new body of work that humanizes his young subjects as they go through their daily lives sharing the tender moments of love and loss that came to encapsulate the late 70s and early 80s as the Summer of Love slowly eroded and gave way to punks’ disaffected view of the world.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_Books_Order_of_Appearance_Spreads_08_1024px_1024x1024.jpg?v=1527102474,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_Books_Order_of_Appearance_Spreads_01_1024px_1024x1024.jpg?v=1527102479|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_Books_Order_of_Appearance_Spreads_03_1024px_1024x1024.jpg?v=1527102478|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_Books_Order_of_Appearance_Spreads_07_1024px_1024x1024.jpg?v=1527102473|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_Books_Order_of_Appearance_Spreads_22_1024px_1024x1024.jpg?v=1527102469|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_Books_Order_of_Appearance_Spreads_18_1024px_1024x1024.jpg?v=1527102470|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW_Books_Order_of_Appearance_Spreads_20_1024px_1024x1024.jpg?v=1527102473,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/order-of-appearance
Annual Series No. 6 — Four Book Set,Guido Guidi / Jason Fulford / Gregory Halpern / Viviane Sassen,false,"Guido Guidi | Jason Fulford | Gregory Halpern | Viviane Sassen
 
Clothbound hardcover with tip-on8.75 x 11 in. / 222 x 279 mmEdition of 1,0002018ISBN 978-1-942953-33-3
 
The four artists included in Annual Series No. 6 have each crafted a monograph charged with an essence of the surreal, exploring the passage of time and the imprecise nature of the phenomenal. Together, these narratives weave a continuum from book to book, creating a dreamlike photographic timeline spanning forty years.
 
 

Dietro Casa by Guido Guidi
A prosaic rock pile marks our entry into Guido Guidi’s playfully strange visual journal, a nod to the days past of early 1980s Italy. Acting as both metronome setting the narrative pace and homage to the great Walker Evans, the rock pile ebbs into new shapes and sizes as cats cross paths, friends survey the curious space that is Dietro Casa (“behind the house”), apparitions double-expose across our field of vision, and a young girl wakes from the book's gentle dreamscape. Guidi’s command of the medium lends itself to performance and cinema, establishing the tone for the three books that follow as they build on the ethereal stage he so masterfully sets.
 














 
Clayton's Ascent by Jason Fulford
Employing a playful and thought provoking use of sequencing and layout that is unmistakably Jason Fulford's, Clayton’s Ascent is a fitting complement to Dietro Casa. Shot between 1997 and 2003 while traveling the US by motorcycle, Fulford’s saturated colors are infused with a veiled foreboding, drawing a blurred line between the real and artificial. Deriving its title from the historic, 1835 nine-hour hot air balloon excursion, Fulford fills the shoes of observer and protagonist, as our sights shift from scenes of a simultaneously fantastic and tumultuous American landscape, to the top tiers of indoor arenas, and finally arcing towards the heavens as we gaze down from above the clouds bidding a receding Earth farewell.
 














 
 
Confederate Moons by Gregory Halpern
During a summer marked by a total eclipse of the sun, known colloquially as ""The Great American Eclipse"" Halpern chose North and South Carolina as the stage in which to capture this rare and fleeting event, one which had not been visible across the entire contiguous United States since June 8, 1918.
Halpern was particularly drawn to the ways in which the drama of that celestial coincidence intersected with the moments of life that directly preceded and followed it that year. Although the idea for the book was initially inspired by this celestial phenomenon, the work ultimately became more of a meditation of the current state of the nation and on that  which separates and conversely bring us together. “I was fascinated,” Halpern says, “by the idea that the entire nation was staring at the sun, reveling in the apocalyptic thrill of watching the moon temporarily extinguish our life-source, all together.”
 














 


Heliotrope by Viviane Sassen
Heliotrope is a collection of images in which Sassen investigates new ways of making and altering photographs that she shot on recent travels to Ethiopia, Morocco, Mozambique, Senegal and South Africa. ""I aim at subverting the way I look at these images, and at the world. Color, graphic shapes and shadows are my tools to revisit, reinterpret and gather a different understanding of what seems familiar. The ordinary and the magical merge. The series is underpinned by the impulse to explore unknown territories, physical or metaphorical.""
A clear departure from Sassen's previous book works, Heliotrope alludes to a photographic future with endless technical possibilities for a medium still in its infancy.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/tbw_books_annual_series_6_guido_guidi_dietro_casa_spread_03_1024px_1024x1024.jpg?v=1528933092,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/tbw_books_annual_series_6_guido_guidi_dietro_casa_spread_10_1024px_1024x1024.jpg?v=1528933181|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/tbw_books_annual_series_6_guido_guidi_dietro_casa_spread_21_1024px_1024x1024.jpg?v=1528933228|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/tbw_books_annual_series_6_jason_fulford_claytons_ascent_spread_10_1024px_1024x1024.jpg?v=1528933442|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/tbw_books_annual_series_6_jason_fulford_claytons_ascent_spread_11_1024px_1024x1024.jpg?v=1528933652|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/tbw_books_annual_series_6_jason_fulford_claytons_ascent_spread_19_1024px_1024x1024.jpg?v=1528933714|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/tbw_books_annual_series_6_gregory_halpern_confederate_moons_spread_07_1024px_1024x1024.jpg?v=1528933815,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/annual-series-no-6-four-book-set

Edition of 1,5009 x 11 in. / 229 x 279 mm2013ISBN 978-1-942953-09-8
 
Bottom of the Lake by Christian Patterson
Working from a unique perspective and restrained stylistic viewpoint, Patterson continues to build on the visual narrative that propelled him to the forefront with his earlier book, Redheaded Peckerwood. In Bottom of the Lake, he revisits his Wisconsin hometown to reveal a dark, cold, and beer soaked world that looks unmistakably his. Bottom of The Lake would later go on to act as the groundwork for a larger body of work of the same name published by Walther König in 2015.
 












 
 
 
Sorry, Welcome by Alessandra Sanguinetti
Sanguinetti veers away from the previous work that cemented her reputation as a photographic powerhouse. Sorry, Welcome is a glimpse into the artist's life the way it looked throughout the winter of 2012. The work was shot over a short period of time in which Sanguinetti took a step back becoming a voyeur of her own life. As a new romantic relationship bridges an ocean of distance we are also privy to watching her own daughter gain a new older sister. The work is pointed, tender, and a loving tribute to the family structure.
 












 
 
 
Erasure by Raymond Meeks
Meek's poetic work plays out as the artist rides a bicycle around his newly adopted east coast home base. Loss and longing share equal roles as the artist traverses the concrete, snapping away in a style that marries the objectivity of Google Street View with the inquisitive sensitivity of Robert Frank. Using printing techniques that involve over-exposing and laying what Meek's calls a ""base fog"" to the image, the artist literally masks what he deems ""the painful and ugly"" in his view of the world. This method of darkroom-manipulation creates an unsettling yet profoundly beautiful and unique book.
 












 
 
Utoquai by Wolfgang Tillmans
Taking his book title from a bathhouse in Zürich, Tillmans closes out the series with a deeply personal visual investigation of a single muse throughout the entirety of the book. It’s rare that a close up photo of an ear or an eye or a knee can be both endlessly interesting and unmistakably authored by one individual, but here Tillmans achieves just that. By re-examining the human body through photography we are left with a new understanding of viewing images by one of the world’s most prominent artists of our time.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/patterson_ss4_03_large.jpg?8720000587798596263,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/patterson_ss4_01_c7031373-1ffa-4c2c-956d-1a6f88dfefad_large.jpg?8720000587798596263|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/patterson_ss4_02_large.jpg?12788775311489894569|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/patterson_ss4_04_large.jpg?18075793236149253534|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/sanguinetti_ss4_06_large.jpg?5632644554226919354|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/sanguinetti_ss4_02_large.jpg?4829557695114343174|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/sanguinetti_ss4_04_large.jpg?4829557695114343174,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/subscription-series-4

Philip & Micheline by Mark Steinmetz
Perhaps some of the most personal images Mark Steinmetz has published, the photographer lovingly follows his parents over the course of ten years as they age, love and eventually leave. This book acts as much as loving memorial and tribute as it does artist book.
 












 
 
 
Balcony by Elaine Stocki
Balcony is a unique exploration of uncertainty and poetic tensions. Stocki’s images pose questions about psychological limitations as well as the chaos of human interactions. All the while a cast of character's assembled through model-wanted ads on Craigslist stubbornly provide the viewer no real answers. 
 












 
 
 
Lifting Water by Dru Donovan
The artist investigates via reenactment the loss of a loved one. Through hired actors the artist would work rapidly in a confined space, in this case a hotel room, relying on memory, intuition and instinct to create a grouping of images that reads equal parts film noir, Broadway play and cinéma vérité at once.  
 
















  
 
 
N. by Katy Grannan
One of the great portraitists of our time, here we find Grannan giving all power up to a muse she has developed a close working relationship with throughout the years. In this case the artist simply shoots the images while the subject, Nicole, directs herself telling Grannan it's time they make some ""real pictures.” The notions of subject-as-artist, exhibitionism, sexuality, power dynamics and the gaze all come into play at once.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/steinmetz_ss3_02_large.jpg?2843554603958855590,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/steinmetz_ss3_03_large.jpg?2843554603958855590|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/steinmetz_ss3_01_large.jpg?2843554603958855590|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/steinmetz_ss3_04_large.jpg?2843554603958855590|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/stocki_ss3_02_large.jpg?5094428977578066657|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/stocki_ss3_01_large.jpg?5094428977578066657|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/stocki_ss3_03_large.jpg?5094428977578066657,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/subscription-series-3

Mimi Plumb’s Landfall encapsulates the anxieties of a world spinning out of balance, a mirror-land eerily reminiscent of our own time. The burnt-out remains of a house fire open out onto equally decimated alpine landscapes, group shots of humans in lackadaisical embrace with high tech weapons of war... Plumb’s photographs of manmade scars and refuse mingle in seductive rhythm with portraits of friends and strangers in disquieting poses, reveling in the underlying unease the artist saw in herself, her community, and the world at large.

Special edition available here
 
TBW Books and Éditions Images Vevey are pleased to present Christian Patterson’s Gong Co., a monumental memento mori to the decline and decay of a family-owned grocery store in the heart of the Mississippi Delta, from which the book takes its name. 
When Patterson first encountered the store in 2003, it was still open for business but seemingly stuck in time, its shelves scattered with long-expired products. It was like an unintentional time capsule, and an uncanny fulfillment of Andy Warhol’s prophecy that “Someday, all department stores will become museums, and all museums will become department stores.” Over the next twenty years, Patterson diligently documented the store's slow disintegration. In 2013, its doors were closed, with its contents left inside. Patterson continued to access the store until the day it was gutted in late 2019.
Gong Co. invites readers to engage in a visceral and visual exploration. Through Patterson’s eclectic mix of on-site and studio photographs, monotypes, trompe l’oeil collages, and cryptic handwritten notes, the book becomes a dynamic and multi-layered experience. Marcel Duchamp’s readymades or Dieter Roth’s Flacher Abfall (Flat Waste) come to mind, where everyday objects are transformed into art through context and presentation. The book offers endless opportunities for interpretation.
The book format acts as a sculptural work in itself. Patterson has crafted an artist book object, presented as an aged and worn green, clothbound cover wrapped in a brown paper jacket resembling a grocery sack. Each page is a testament to Patterson’s meticulous attention to detail, incorporating elements such as mold and foxing marks, as if caused by heavy southern humidity, now forever embedded into the book's pages. 
Gong Co. is a profound exploration of how we engage with the artistic representation of America and “the South”—a place shaped in popular imagination by great photographers and writers like William Eggleston, Walker Evans, William Faulkner, and Harper Lee. But Patterson delves more deeply into the impermanence of it all; and of a now long-outworn sense of America itself.
A special edition of 200 signed, numbered copies of Gong Co. will also be available. Each has been carefully altered by Patterson to include a wild variety of inserted materials, much of it culled directly from the store, a tipped-in photographic print, and vintage wrapping paper.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/1_1293dddd-9729-45fc-a007-85ae25d251f6.jpg?v=1730230071,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/2_58adfb25-6fd4-4b5c-abc8-e9c21f626cdb.jpg?v=1730230072|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/3_3cbd1629-4ac8-43a2-ad74-a2a731660aab.jpg?v=1730230071|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/4_9aaf81cc-9110-487d-a52b-d2ec301b3b2d.jpg?v=1730230071|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/5.jpg?v=1730230071|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/6.jpg?v=1730230071|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/7.jpg?v=1730230071,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/gong-co
Master Rituals II: Weston's Nudes,Tarrah Krajnak,false,"Edition of 500Muslin-wrapped casebound56 pages, 21 plates10 x 13.5 in. / 254 x 343 mmsigned and numbered by the artist2022ISBN 978-1-942953-58-6

 Deconstructing Edward Weston’s Nudes in the form of self-portraits, the artist Tarrah Krajnak inserts herself as both author and subject into Weston’s original work. Replicating the poses of models Bertha Wardell and Charis Wilson, she sits before the camera with a remote shutter release in hand, her body depicted beyond the boundaries of Weston’s original fragmentation, confronting the lens with a light meter, a gas mask, a defiant gaze. Krajnak’s critical homage subverts not only the decidedly male compositional apparatus behind Weston’s figure studies—her control of the frame foregrounds the agency of the posing women—but also the ideal of white female beauty central to Weston’s work and its historical appreciation. Awarded the Jury Prize of the Louis Roederer Discovery Award at Les Rencontres d’Arles in 2021, Master Rituals II: Weston’s Nudes interjects itself as commentary into the photographic canon while existing on its own as an independent work of masterful concept, execution, and expression.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TR_MR_38.jpg?v=1686774036,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TR_MR_13_9abd0f16-c9f0-409e-83da-c1ac68fe2138.jpg?v=1686772867|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TR_MR_15_90e0bab2-60aa-4503-b4c3-14f82f8b9d13.jpg?v=1686772871|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TR_MR_16_e3674e1c-d241-4274-8fc1-7e9710e49e85.jpg?v=1686772875|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TR_MR_19.jpg?v=1686773992|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TR_MR_23_80b36814-59e8-4b2d-bf48-de15796021e5.jpg?v=1686773996|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TR_MR_25_d8f67967-c939-408e-b6dd-8bd4efc99f76.jpg?v=1686774000,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/master-rituals-ii-westons-nudes

Orifice + Aperture is a new collection of studio studies by Paul Mpagi Sepuya. In the collaborative style for which he has become renowned, Sepuya uses mirrors, screens, and the loaded visual motif of the camera lens to address structures within photography, portraiture, and queer sociality. Either handheld or fixed upon tripods, the physical camera is permanently in-frame while moments of intimacy and creative acts of self-representation play out before it, drawing spontaneous connections between the formation of photographic subjectivity and the artist's visual process.

TBW Books is pleased to present River’s Dream, the latest monograph by Curran Hatleberg and a complete realization of the series exhibited at the 2019 Whitney Biennial. 
Hatleberg is known for traveling America, guided by intuition, to create scenes of American life and landscape. Working collaboratively with the people he meets, he recounts intimate stories of family and community. Here, in the follow-up to his first monograph Lost Coast (TBW Books, 2016), Hatleberg centers his narrative on the dog days of summer. Sweltering heat, dripping humidity, lush vegetation, and screaming insects—River’s Dream is a pulsing and episodic hallucination of life lived outdoors. In these sixty-five photographs, we move through swamps and groves, front yards and junkyards, encountering moments of haunting mystery and beautiful impermanence. Heightened by formal repetition, echo, and refrain, everyday scenes take on surreal, allegorical qualities. In the end, Hatleberg leaves us with the impression of memory, where the past is never gone, but appears and reappears endlessly, as in the flickering of a dream.
This book includes new texts by Natasaha Trethewey and Joy Williams.

Restraint and Desire,Ken Graves and Eva Lipman,false,"Hardcover90 pages, 39 duotone plates9.25 x 10.5 inches / 235 x 267 mm2021ISBN 978-1-942953-46-3
Restraint and Desire is the culmination of a lifelong creative partnership between husband and wife Ken Graves and Eva Lipman, whose visionary life together was defined by the unique and selfless act of claiming artistic credit as a singular entity.
For decades they acutely surveyed high school dances, military ceremonies, football games, boxing matches, and other American social rituals, seeking to capture the complex intensity between humans often overlooked in these commonplace settings. These mostly prosaic happenings often revealed sexual tensions that Ken and Eva saw not only in the world around them, but in their own relationship. As Eva says, “our work reflected back to us, like a mirror, the intensities and power dynamics of our shared life together.” Acts of generosity and humility, domination and submission, passions, both violent and tender, straight and homoerotic, are all beautifully enhanced through the intimacy of the photographs.
With a profound visual sensitivity, Graves and Lipman collect human gestures that betray the complex interiority of their subjects. Hands often act here as the protagonist—grabbing, touching, reaching—entering and exiting the photographs like a visual metronome. Lust, fear, boredom, exhaustion and a myriad of feelings beyond the realm of language are all on display through the discerning glare of their camera and its flash.
Published in tandem with Derby, by Ken Graves and Eva Lipman.

Knit Club,Carolyn Drake,false,"Hardcover118 pages, 50 color plates8 x 11 in. / 203 x 279 mmEssay by Rebecca Bengal2020ISBN 978-1-942953-40-1
A foreboding meditation in the vein of Southern Gothic literature, Drake’s most recent body of work emerged through her collaboration with an enigmatic group of women loosely calling themselves “Knit Club.” The nature of the club is ambiguous. It is a cross between a gang, a cult of mysteries, and a group of friends bound by secrets only they share.
The book follows a narrative structure loosely borrowed from Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying—that is to say, not one omniscient narrator but many disparate stream-of-consciousness voices. We sense the authorship of the photographs to be collaborative, the result of creative play between Drake and the club in which she found herself embedded, their process a kind of alchemy. In the style of the Gothic, Drake’s masterful use of color to create mood opens the door to the tension between the real and the supernatural. What we find, however, is not grotesque but something vital. A community that manages to exist outside the gaze or control of men. Women, children, and mothers, shrouded in masks and mystery to live a life on their own terms.
Following three critically acclaimed self-released books—Two Rivers (2013), Wild Pigeon (2014), and Internat (2017)—Knit Club is the first book Drake has made in collaboration with a publisher. Drake is the recipient of a Guggenheim fellowship, among many other awards, and became a member of Magnum Photos in 2019.

Arena,Jeff Mermelstein,false,"Clothbound hardcover with tip-on140 pages, 71 plates13.5 x 11.75 in. / 343 x 298 mmAfterword by Robert Slifkin2019ISBN 978-1-942953-37-1
Arena was shot during a four year tenure that began in 2012 on the day Barclays Center in Brooklyn first opened its doors to the public. Charged with the extraordinary commission to photograph over 350 events held in Barclays’ first years, Arena marks a particularly prolific period of Jeff Mermelstein’s career.
Though known for works created against the backdrop of the streets of N.Y.C., here Mermelstein moves inward through the lobbies, hallways, and snaking corridors that funnel spectators and staff alike toward the center’s hallowed stage.
He maneuvers through the shuffling crowds, slowing down, crouching low, casting his gaze toward the pedestrian and discarded to illuminate a new path: a vision leading away from the main attraction, back towards the uncommon-common. Mermelstein revels in the vibrant-uncanny embedded in the overlooked and mundane.
We never see a basketball game, a concert, or boxing match, instead our eyes fix upon more revealing and intriguing spontaneous sightings:
– Bright lights glisten across plastic sweat and the sheen of well-heeled artificial tans.
– A deserted latex glove on the terrazzo floor channels a crime scene next to a half-gallon of spilled ketchup.
– Hands exchange greetings, limbs entangle across knots of bodies, and a quiver-full of forks spear into plattered hors d'oeuvres.
– Magic mirrors cast would-be reflections off of white-Tees to merch buyers as an endless chain of receipt tape ticks off the consumables carried hand-over-fist-over-mouth through throngs of standing-room-only.
This interzone, teeming with compelling denizens and mystical happenstance is the crux of Mermelstein’s Arena, a deeply sensitive and loving observation of the eccentricities of human behavior condensed within a corten-steel terrarium; a photographic opus in seventy-one vivid, flash-fried images.
Jeff Mermelstein lives in Brooklyn, NY. He is the author of Sidewalk (1999), No Title Here (2003), and Twirl×Run (2009).

Ayu no Kaze,Asako Shimazaki,false,"Hardcover80 pages, 30 plates6.25 x 8.75 inches / 159 x 222 mmAfterword by Sandra Phillips, Curator Emeritus of Photography, SFMOMA2019ISBN 978-1-942953-41-8
Found in Japan’s oldest book of poetry, Ayu no Kaze is a sailor’s phrase meaning “the wind of promise.” Much like the ancient word “ayu” translates to “the sea brings various things to the land” so too has the phrase spread throughout the islands of Japan, weaving through common people's lives, in folk songs sung by fishermen, merchants, travelers and immigrants alike.
After moving to the US, Shimazaki returned to Japan time and again to visit her native land. Choosing to work by herself in the early morning, roaming from northern, through central, to coastal Japan, scarcely any people inhabit her photographs of the summer and winter countryside. 
Alone through mild sun and fierce blizzards, her images are an exploration of a land left behind. A diary of yearning and serenity, Shimazaki’s gaze poetically alludes to life transitions that are at once privately intimate and deeply universal. The photographs land softly, quietly belying the magnitude of the elements, both inner and outer, that charge through the landscapes and her lens—as she puts it “no matter the changes in our lives and culture, Ayu no Kaze returns every year. It speaks to me of eternity.”",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/AyunoKaze_02_2048x2048.jpg?v=1586212916,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/AyunoKaze_04_2048x2048.jpg?v=1586213246|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/AyunoKaze_06_2048x2048.jpg?v=1586213298|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/AyunoKaze_07_2048x2048.jpg?v=1586213338|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/AyunoKaze_15_2048x2048.jpg?v=1586213415|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/AyunoKaze_16_2048x2048.jpg?v=1586213464|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/AyunoKaze_17_2048x2048.jpg?v=1586213544,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/ayu-no-kaze
Manifest,Kristine Potter,false,"Embossed paperbound hardcover with tip-ons92 pages, 48 duotone plates 9.5 x 11.25 in. / 241 x 286 mmAfterword by Stanley Wolukau-Wanambwa2018ISBN 978-1-942953-34-0
Created while working in remote areas along the Western slope of Colorado between 2012 and 2015, Kristine Potter builds on her previous investigations of masculinity and the American Soldier, here fixing her gaze on a parallel archetype, the American Cowboy.
Uncovering a world far more formidable and disorienting than the canon of traditional western landscape photography had previously detailed, Potter encounters men who sparingly dot the terrain, seemingly both tethered to, and in divergence with, the myth that precedes them. 
Manifest does not act as a documentary, but rather as a re-coding of the western myth, the territory and its men, it is both fantasy and reality. 
Weaving body and landscape, the book lays open the seduction of the West, the opportunities it promises, the disorientation of altitude, and the confrontation of persistent danger.

Set against the science fiction backdrop of a crowdless and LED-lined arena, Drew Brown's AIRGAP depicts a cold and intimate world of contact sport. On the ice, we follow plastic-clad hockey players as they rotate through shifts of observation, play, and recovery. We see helmets clap together in a scrum against the boards, the exhale of wet air on plexiglass, and a player's face cut by shadow as he enters the penalty box. Outside of the rink, players engineer their bodies to perform and rebuild—one man disappears into a cylinder of cryo-smoke, another strains over a training bike, his breath turned to data by a machine. Experiential and evidentiary, these photographs throw light on glass, sweat, wounds, and ice, equalizing the physical details of the game and its effects on the body. Splicing ice hockey with a hallucinatory space ride, AIRGAP drops the viewer into a realm where humans and technology merge under a grid of electric light.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW-Books-Airgap-Drew-Brown-Detail-06_1024x1024.jpg?v=1520465875,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW-Books-Airgap-Drew-Brown-Detail-07_1024x1024.jpg?v=1520465719|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW-Books-Airgap-Drew-Brown-Detail-12_1024x1024.jpg?v=1520465748|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW-Books-Airgap-Drew-Brown-Detail-13_1024x1024.jpg?v=1520465732|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW-Books-Airgap-Drew-Brown-Detail-21_1024x1024.jpg?v=1520465787|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW-Books-Airgap-Drew-Brown-Detail-24_1024x1024.jpg?v=1520465803|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/TBW-Books-Airgap-Drew-Brown-Detail-32_1024x1024.jpg?v=1520465837,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/airgap

Boardwalk Minus Forty by Mike Mandel
Created during the artist's time as a student at the San Francisco Art Institute, Boardwalk Minus Forty was one of Mandel's first serious forays into what he jokingly refers to as ""real photographs."" Known later for his conceptual bodies of work, most notably Evidence, created with fellow artist Larry Sultan in the late 1970s and now regarded by many as one of photography’s most influential photo books, Boardwalk is a rare look back at the foundation the artist was building all along.
 

























 


Prince Street Girls by Susan Meiselas


Shot during a short period in the late 1970s in New York's Lower East Side, Meiselas developed a close and lasting bond with a group of eleven neighborhood girls, collectively known as the Prince Street Girls. This book is an intimate and sprawling view of the girls’ formative years in an ever-changing city. Meisalas, a highly renowned and respected photographer, works today as a member of Magnum. Her early 1970s work, Carnival Strippers, and her following work in Nicaragua remain seminal photographic achievements to this day. 
 
 

























 
 
They Shall Take Up Serpents by Bill Burke
 


Continuing with Burke's tradition of examining niche American cultures, Serpents pulls us into the surreal, intense, and at times consuming world of coal miners doubling as religious snake handlers by the work-week's end. Here we see Burke building a lyrical narrative connecting the two groups that feels effortless. Known for using a variety of camera and film formats, Burke strings together images that alone might seem out of place but together weave the iconic storytelling the artist has become widely known and respected for.
 
 



























 





Head by Lee Friedlander


Spanning fifty years of the artist's work, Friedlander dove into his archives to assemble a collection of images that crystallizes one of his signature shooting motifs. The book oscillates in tone from serious to humorous and back again. With a fluidity that belies the seemingly disparate images, Friedlander reminds viewers of his brilliance as both photographer and master of the bookmaking medium. Head is a fascinating glimpse into the process and approach of one of the world's most important and enigmatic living artists.

Once in Harlem,Katsu Naito,false,"Embossed paperbound hardcover with tip-on100 pages, 55 duotone plates9.25 x 11.5 inches / 235 x 292 mm2017ISBN 978-1-942953-32-6
In 1983, at only 18 years of age, Katsu Naito arrived in New York from his native Japan to work as a contracted kitchen chef.
By 1988 he had settled in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood, an area only just recovering from the brutal economic devastation of the 1970s, and on the cusp of the drastic dislocation brought upon longtime residents of this historically black community in the 1990s. 
An outsider in all but residence, Naito traced the streets of his neighborhood on foot, camera in hand, for two years before shooting his first frame. Slowly, Naito became familiar with the people and community he was living amongst, and they with him. Gradually, the necessary trust was built to record, with quiet tenderness, a time and place that would soon undergo an abrupt transformation. Organically, Naito was welcomed in as a member of his Harlem neighborhood.
Bringing together landscape photography, environmental portraits, and makeshift plein air studio portraits (reminiscent of Richard Avedon's more elaborate outdoor staging) charged with the empathy and warmth of a kindred spirit, Once in Harlem is as much a continuation of the American photographic tradition of foreign-born artists chronicling American peoples and customs as it is vital historical document.
Once in Harlem, Naito's second monograph and first with TBW Books, builds on his remarkable ability to intimately engage with his subjects to create emotional dialogues that can transcend bounds of ethnicity, gender, and socio-economic strata, to, as he puts it, ""look into each other’s soul to build another dimension of a relationship.""

In Lost Coast, Curran Hatleberg presents an episodic narrative about Eureka, California. Intimate portraits of town and people function like a collection of short stories, building to an understanding of place. The pictures live between extremes, between the grand and the granular, between the breathtaking natural landscape and the grim realities of industrial decline.

The resulting portraits of everyday life contain stirring moments of intimacy, each frame its own micro narrative about life in the town. The pictures could be documents or dreams, but they all center on the strange beauty of an overlooked American life. An oversized golden foil stamp was selected for the cover of the book with the knowledge that it would fleck and become embedded in the fibers of the book cloth the more it was held, referencing both California's nickname and the region's distorted promises.
 
Curran Hatleberg received his MFA from Yale University. He has had numerous exhibitions, notably at Higher Pictures and Fraenkel Gallery. Hatleberg is the recipient of a Magnum Emergency Fund and an Aaron Siskind Grant. Hatleberg's work can be found, among others, in the collections of SF MOMA and the Center for Contemporary Photography.

Mirrors was derived from Eric Oglander’s online project, Craigslist Mirrors. Described as a document of Oglander’s continued search via Craigslist for compelling photos of mirrors, his site is a display case for these culled objects; artifacts recovered from a well of online obscurity.
 
Refocusing the essence of the project’s emergent themes (anonymity, fragmented realities, voyeurism, notions of truth, and crowdsourcing) the book distills Oglander's project down from a diffuse cloud of images-of-objects-that-cast-images, back again to object itself. The images collected here pull the viewer's gaze through the page to the cross-section of two narrow planes of someone’s reality. They are glances that teem with a sense of further exploration if we could just direct our view behind us.
 
Mirrors embodies Oglander’s desire to explore minimal forms amongst a vast community’s subconscious endeavor to transmit the formless.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/MIR_grid_01_2e8535f2-c6f5-49a4-b485-625d094c23a3_large.jpg?12201084117230834763,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/MIR_grid_01_ee56e540-02e2-49ee-8f9a-2235358886f4_large.jpg?12201084117230834763|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/MIR_grid_03_large.jpg?6782293189537322620|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/MIR_grid_04_large.jpg?6782293189537322620|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/MIR_grid_05_large.jpg?6782293189537322620|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/MIR_grid_06_large.jpg?6782293189537322620|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/MIR_grid_07_large.jpg?2613128557545322667,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/mirrors

The darkness of the theatre sets the mood; the illuminated screen playing the role of a mouth whose light screams out to be heard, to be seen; the EXIT signs… reminders of where all the absent characters have gone.




— Michael Nelson, excerpt from Assignment No. 2




Assignment No. 2 is a visual document inspired by the writing of Michael Nelson, an inmate serving a twenty-five to life sentence in San Quentin Prison. Written while in solitary confinement in 2011 in response to a request to evaluate two photographs, the essay finds voice through the images of artists Hiroshi Sugimoto and Richard Misrach to create an eloquently piercing contemplation on the experience and mindset of an American inmate.
 
The project’s origins lie in the Prison University Project, a non-profit organization that provides inmates at San Quentin an opportunity to earn an AA degree. The title is derived from the second written response prompt in Visual Concerns in Photography, a class led by artists and professors Doug Dertinger and Nigel Poor.
 
Meticulously reproduced from the legal pad the essay was drafted on, each folio is uniquely hand stamped with title and date. The folio’s dynamic writing and imagery is paired with an equally sculptural physicality to create a sensory and tactile experience that is unlike anything produced by TBW Books to date.

Ohio by Todd Hido
Hido revisits adolescence in a way that is haunting and beautifully displayed before us. Using the same camera he made his earliest photos with as a child, the artist seamlessly combines his vintage and contemporary works into a narrative that is uniquely his. In forty short pages we are able move from adolescence to young adulthood.
 












 
 
Away by Abner Nolan
As an early adopter of the use of found imagery, Nolan continues his investigation of the medium of narrative through photography to build a tome that when coupled with the title leaves us with the exact mood the title suggests. A brilliant use of image, sequence and abstract narrative.
 












 
 
Noon by Marianne Mueller
Often using her own body as a way of directing viewers through an intimate time and place, Mueller evokes a static sculptural quality in the human form rarely found in contemporary portraiture. Visually stunning pairings offer viewers glimpse into Mueller's wonderful body of work.
 












 
 
Sheep by Alec Soth
We begin by looking intently at Alec Soth's images of sheep that are eerily reminiscent of Flemish oil paintings only to find we have been lured into a bait and switch where the artist quickly reveals we are watching as he recounts his own sleeping disorder.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/hido_ss2_01_large.jpg?8623409995214767307,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/hido_ss2_04_large.jpg?8623409995214767307|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/hido_ss2_02_large.jpg?8623409995214767307|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/hido_ss2_03_large.jpg?8623409995214767307|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/nolan_ss2_01_large.png?7425051998352572838|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/nolan_ss2_02_large.png?7425051998352572838|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/7969/files/nolan_ss2_03_large.jpg?3558963917078880180,sold-out,https://tbwbooks.com/products/subscription-series-2

It Ended Sad, but I Love Where it Began by Jim Goldberg
Goldberg continues to use the book format to build on a visual photographic language he helped to create. By presenting Polaroids, 35mm, large format, and digital photos in one space a cohesion is created not only by the artist's own vision but the narrative he presents through handwritten notes scribed directly onto the photos by both the artist and the subject, blurring the lines of authorship until a poetic narrative presents itself.

 












 
 
Living in the New Rome by Ari MarcopoulosMarcopoulos continues his use of family as subject matter, this time focusing on his two sons as they grow and navigate a world of mystical colors, playing dress up in the woods or tending to a broken finger. Never afraid to take a visual risk, Marcopoulos is quick to mine his archive and include a photograph of Basquiat bathing and quickly juxtapose it with androgynous youth. When viewed alongside the book's title these images represent a future of endless strength and possibility, one the artist might hope for his own children. 
 












 
 
Tiny Clustering Lights vs. Infinite Darkness Forever or How Many Humans Does it Take to Change a Lightbulb by Paul Schiek
A follow up to his first book, Good By Angels, this body of work builds on the already strange photographic language Schiek was using in his earlier work. Again dark and playful, Schiek experiments heavily with the book format and layout, even offering viewers two titles (one optimistic and one pessimistic, respectfully) from which to choose while viewing the book. 
 












 
Tones of Dirt and Bone by Mike BrodieBrodie's images string together like a film with no real beginning, middle or end. The viewer seems to have landed in the middle of a world that either never existed or always will. Comprised of some of Brodie's earliest Polaroid images, Tones of Dirt and Bone would later be published as an expanded trade edition book.
