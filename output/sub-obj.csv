Your Town Tomorrow;Corine Vermeulen;FALSE;"Your Town Tomorrow is Dutch photographer Corine Vermeulen’s long term documentary project on the city of Detroit. This 160 page hardcover monograph measures 9.25 x 11.5″ and features 105 plates, and a debossed and foil stamped cover. Subjectively Objective founder and curator Noah Waldeck helped bring the project to life by color correcting the photographs, preparing the files for print, and serving as a technical consultant on the project. So although it’s not one of our own publications, we’re happy to make it available through our shop. Here is Corine’s description of the project:
“Photographed between 2007 and 2017, Your Town Tomorrow chronicles the city of Detroit as it enters the great recession, and then later as it emerged as a site for reinvestment and gentrification. Although documentary in format, it is also a very personal series as it runs parallel with my own life and work in Detroit, and portrays the communities where I have lived, as well as my friends and neighbors.
As economic interests, new developments and corporate investors continue to alter the structure of the city, Your Town Tomorrow portrays Detroit communities intertwining in the midst of challenging transitions, including young families, activists, urban farmers, and long-time residents. With these photographs I aim to activate a larger conversation about the United States today. When we feel our political system is failing us, how do we move forward? These images depict many of the grassroots organizations and activist groups in Detroit that have pioneered creative ways of dealing with America’s social and economic issues. Your Town Tomorrow explores new topographies and forms of urbanism during a time when everyday life stands at a crossroads between hope and despair, vulnerability and strength, the past and the future.";https://subjectivelyobjective.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Your-Town-Tomorrow-Cover.jpg;https://subjectively.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Your-Town-Tomorrow-Cover.jpg|https://subjectively.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Your-Town-Tomorrow-Spread-01.jpg|https://subjectively.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Your-Town-Tomorrow-Spread-02.jpg|https://subjectively.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Your-Town-Tomorrow-Spread-03.jpg;available;https://subjectivelyobjective.com/product/corine-vermeulen-your-town-tomorrow/
