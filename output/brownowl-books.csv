Letting Go,Anastasia Davis,false,"Released February 2026
Edition of 50

163 x 203mm
Saddle stitched
Black and white/colour
After great pain, a formal feeling comes –
The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs –
The stiff Heart questions ‘was it He, that bore,’
And ‘Yesterday, or Centuries before’?
The Feet, mechanical, go round –
A Wooden way
Of Ground, or Air, or Ought –
Regardless grown,
A Quartz contentment, like a stone –
This is the Hour of Lead –
Remembered, if outlived,
As Freezing persons, recollect the Snow –
First – Chill – then Stupor – then the letting go –
Emily Dickinson - After great pain, a formal feeling comes,",https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/418471959/lettinggo1.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200,https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/418471953/lettinggo2.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200|https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/418471956/lettinggo3.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200|https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/418471962/lettinggo4.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200,available,https://www.brownowlpress.com/product/lettinggo

Wanderlust chronicles a journey west, to Montana.

South Florida is a strange place for me. It is where I spent my early childhood. It was where my father and stepmother still live. I visit at least once a year. I haven't lived there in over 35 years but I dream of its landscape more so than any other. The murky canals and palms swaying. All the wild reptiles. As a child, I had so much fear of the natural world there. I still do. There's an energy there that radiates from the ground, something that feels so primal, so fundamental, that it borders on the supernatural.
All images are stills from 8mm film shot around Tampa, Florida and a long kayak ride down the Hillsborough River in January of 2016.

Footnote is based on photography as a physical form of information – a carrier of narratives and an imperfect form of memory. The exhibition starts with the idea that a picture is worth a thousand words and turns it on its head. It turns in to a game between the photograph, as an inadequate substitute for words, and footnotes, used to add and deepen thoughts in written language. This way, the photograph could function as writing, and writing could function as another form of image.",https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/381138975/footnote1.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200,https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/381138972/footnote2.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200|https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/381138969/footnote3.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200|https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/381138978/footnote4.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200,available,https://www.brownowlpress.com/product/footnote

In 2018 I realised a large body of work called Iceberg. I was able to collaborate with a talented designer, Horst Kiechle, who created paper models of icebergs for me. Once constructed I was able to photograph them in my studio. I put the models on plinths, upended them, suspended them, shot them on unfamilar backgrounds, tried to remove the idea and context of an ‘iceberg’. Initially the Polaroids were meant purely as tests and studies for the final work, used to check exposure and lighting but they ended up becoming a project in their own right. An encapsulated body with its own aesthetic, which could be separated from, but which was also an annex to, the main film project.

Also available as an edition with two instant prints.
I was given a new polaroid camera a few months after I met Meghan. Shooting pictures with it brought me back to two decades earlier, when I first started as a photographer after becoming involved in the DIY and punk scene. That scene inspired me to make whatever art I could with the tools I had available. I took my hand-me-down polaroid camera with me everywhere. In 2021 I drove to Nashville, Tennessee, every weekend to see Meghan. I would shoot whenever I could in the still, mostly locked-down world. In this spirit of my DIY scene roots, I used the tools I had available to me and my all-in-one printer/scanner at work, to make scans. The results are imperfect, the scans aren't the best, and there is some dust, but the pictures show what that era felt like, driving between the Midwest and South to see my new love. It was an adventure.

In the Basement is a series of large format camera photographs made in the early 2000’s of spaces where punk music was played or celebrated, as they exist on their own, absent of live music.
Historically the photography of punk has focused on the people who make punk. Many of these images were made using 35mm cameras. Large format photography is a slow process using a large cumbersome camera. The photos often have a planned quality that is counter to the impulsive images made by a hand held portable camera. Small format cameras are perfect for capturing the energy of the punk scene while my images admire the quieter moments in between the chaos.",https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/336659103/inthebasement1.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200,https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/336659106/inthebasement2.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200|https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/336659109/inthebasement3.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200|https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/336659112/inthebasement4.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200,available,https://www.brownowlpress.com/product/karen-kirchhoff-in-the-basement

“I found that I was in the midst of a shift. A shift between the old world and the new world. My romantic notions of travelling to a mystical land of beauty and power were cut short when instead, I found a place half in the past and half in the future that echoed more about home than I had expected to find.”",https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/235100402/ameenarojeehardwork1.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200,https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/235100408/ameenarojeehardwork2.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200|https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/235100414/ameenarojeehardwork3.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200|https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/235100405/ameenarojeehardwork4.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200|https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/235100411/ameenarojeehardwork5.png?auto=format&fit=max&h=1200&w=1200,available,https://www.brownowlpress.com/product/hardwork

The images are a street-level glimpse into Death By Audio, Glasslands, 285 Kent, Monster Island and Dead Herring with appearances by artists like Shannon and the Clams, Liquor Store, Kid Congo Powers and the Pink Monkeybirds, JEFF the Brotherhood and more.

Essay by Ginevra Shay
Life is Full of Possibilities was an exercise in excessiveness. Using the camera and the act of photographing as an excuse to always say yes, I documented my life over the course of one year. Focusing on trying to understand the possibilities of a moment, the act of being present and engaged was first and foremost, and any attempt to make a ""good"" picture was secondary.
This edit of images is culled from approximately 3000 images taken in 2008, all of which were shot on color 35mm film and exist somewhere as 4”x6” prints.

I have traveled somewhat extensively over the past 5 to 6 years.  Nearly every mile was logged as the wheels tumbled down the road.  I found myself on a plane at minimum.  There's truth in saying, ""on the road.""  Music has been the consistent variable for wanderlust and following the tune will lead to all corners imaginable.  I've yet to lay eyes upon all of which I desire; however, I have seen a lot.  Through all the long days and even longer nights I have released the shutter religiously.  Pictures upon pictures upon pictures upon pictures.  And, this book features none of them.  This book sheds light on what I have unintentionally taken for granted.  Who would want to see the northern Shenandoah Valley of Virginia?  I've asked myself this question time and time again and after many trips across this land I've realized, there's relevant beauty no matter where one resides.  This is not the road.  This decadence is my home.
