An Extremely Un-Get-Atable Place,Craig Easton,false,"‘It’s an extremely un-get-atable place, but it’s a nice house and I think I can make it quite comfortable with a little trouble.’—George Orwell
An Extremely Un-get-atable Place is a lyrical reimagining of the time that writer George Orwell lived at Barnhill, a remote farmhouse on the Isle of Jura in Scotland. It was here that Orwell wrote his landmark book Nineteen Eighty-Four—a dire warning of the dangers of totalitarianism and political despotism. Photographer Craig Easton was invited to stay at Barnhill—largely unchanged since Orwell’s time—where he made a series of landscape and still life images. In Easton’s new book, these photographs are presented alongside extracts from Orwell’s letters and diaries written on the island.","Published December 2025Text by Richard Blair270 x 330 mm100pp, 58 imagesHardbackISBN 978-1-80598-014-8",https://gostbooks.com/cdn/shop/files/AnExtremlyUngetatableplace-Craig-Easton.jpg?v=1765545540&width=1946,https://gostbooks.com/cdn/shop/files/Craig_Easton-An_Extremely_Un-get-atable_Place-4a.jpg?v=1765545540&width=1946|https://gostbooks.com/cdn/shop/files/Craig_Easton-An_Extremely_Un-get-atable_Place-5a.jpg?v=1765545540&width=1946|https://gostbooks.com/cdn/shop/files/Craig_Easton-An_Extremely_Un-get-atable_Place-8a.jpg?v=1765545540&width=1946|https://gostbooks.com/cdn/shop/files/Craig_Easton-An_Extremely_Un-get-atable_Place-3a.jpg?v=1765546181&width=1946|https://gostbooks.com/cdn/shop/files/Craig_Easton-An_Extremely_Un-get-atable_Place-6a.jpg?v=1765546181&width=1946,sold out,https://gostbooks.com/products/an-extremely-un-get-atable-place-craig-easton

It is a sound that can haunt you…’ One of the deadliest wildfires ever recorded took place on 23 July 2018 just 30km from the historical centre of Athens in Greece. Artist Katerina Angelopoulou survived the fire and her forthcoming book The Fumes of Mars combines her photographs with personal testimonies from other survivors, timelines, maps and reports. With these materials Angelopoulou attempts to weave together a collective narrative of the events to better understand the violent disconnect between her own experience and the ‘official’ account of the disaster in which facts were concealed and victims held culpable.","Published September 2025Essays by Michael Herzfeld and Yiannis Gabriel 195 x 255 mm232pp, 101 imagesHardbackISBN 978-1-915423-88-7",https://gostbooks.com/cdn/shop/files/Katerina_Angelopoulou-Fumes_of_Mars-cover-front-V2.jpg?v=1757946135&width=1946,https://gostbooks.com/cdn/shop/files/Katerina_Angelopoulou-Fumes_of_Mars-cover-front_back-V2.jpg?v=1757946179&width=1946|https://gostbooks.com/cdn/shop/files/Katerina_Angelopoulou-Fumes_of_Mars-1.jpg?v=1757946206&width=1946|https://gostbooks.com/cdn/shop/files/Katerina_Angelopoulou-Fumes_of_Mars-2.jpg?v=1757946206&width=1946|https://gostbooks.com/cdn/shop/files/Katerina_Angelopoulou-Fumes_of_Mars-6.jpg?v=1757946206&width=1946|https://gostbooks.com/cdn/shop/files/Katerina_Angelopoulou-Fumes_of_Mars-8.jpg?v=1757946179&width=1946,sold out,https://gostbooks.com/products/the-fumes-of-mars
