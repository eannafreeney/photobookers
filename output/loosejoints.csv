In the Beginning,Roe Ethridge,true,"Ethridge’s cult early studies of the American everyday return in a three-volume set revealing the origins of his style.

Loose Joints is proud to present In the Beginning , a three-volume set reuniting Roe Ethridge’s three formative, self-published books – County Line , Orange Grove and Spare Bedroom – originally released in 2004–05 and long out of print. Across these early volumes, Ethridge stages a sharp, playful inquiry into the American everyday. From rotting Florida citrus orchards to half-built suburban interiors and the static hum of strip-mall signage, each book turns on a clear typological register, where the familiar slides easily into the strange. Ethridge sets his pictures in a dialogue with photographic archetypes – catalogues, calendars, studio models, kitsch displays – using them to probe how images shape, naturalise and sometimes fracture American life.

Ethridge’s early books all emerge from loose typologies that, in their slippages, probe and complicate the aesthetics of American visual culture. From 2004, Orange Grove distills photographs made in a dilapidated Florida orchard into a study of slow collapse, a familiar symbol of American plenty quietly withering on the tree. Self-published simultaneously, 2004’s Spare Bedroom begins Ethridge’s career-long practice of jumbling and juxtaposing the commercial and the personal, in which an early commission for a furniture company unravels into a jagged mix of domestic scenes, catalogue imagery and loosely staged interiors. Finally, County Line (2005) turns to the liminal spaces of Queens and Nassau County, abstracting the language of the strip mall into a concrete-poetry of word-photographs that sit against other images evoking the blurry edges of the suburban sprawl.

Taken together, the three books form a weave of contrasts, where moments of banality tilt towards the uncanny and the absurd. These early publishing experiments trace the emergence of Ethridge’s now-signature method: slanting, doubling and displacing images until they cohere with unexpected force or deliberately fall apart.

Reissued twenty years later, In the Beginning reads as a prefiguration of the more than fifteen books and catalogues that would follow. It marks the opening chapter of an artist who would go on to become one of contemporary photography’s most influential practitioners – revealing the restless, incisive eye that shaped everything to come.

In the Beginning is published to coincide with Roe Ethridge’s exhibition at Gagosian Athens (January 22 – March 7, 2026) and is published simultaneously with Rude in the Good Way .

Roe Ethridge (b. 1969, Miami) lives and works in New York and is widely regarded as a leading figure in contemporary conceptual photography. Working fluidly between commercial and art contexts, Ethridge merges imagery drawn from fashion, advertising, and daily life with art-historical genres, using the real to suggest or disrupt the ideal. His photographs explore the increasingly porous boundary between the generic and the personal, and the way images gain new meaning through sequencing, recombination, and reuse.

Ethridge has published more than fifteen books, including American Polychronic (MACK, 2022), Neighbors (MACK, 2016), Sacrifice Your Body (MACK, 2014), Le Luxe (MACK, 2011), and Rockaway, NY (SteidlMACK, 2007). His commercial collaborations include major ongoing projects with Calvin Klein, Chanel, and Louis Vuitton.

His work has been exhibited widely in the United States and internationally. Significant solo presentations include Momentum 4 , Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2005); Charles Riva Collection , Brussels (2012); Le Consortium, Dijon, and M Museum Leuven (2012–13); and a major mid-career survey, Nearest Neighbo r, at the Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati, for the 2016 FotoFocus Biennial. Ethridge was included in New Photography 2010 at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and in the Whitney Biennial (2008). He was shortlisted for the Deutsche Börse Photography Prize in 2011. Ethridge’s work is held in major public collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and Tate, London

Rude in the Good Way,Roe Ethridge,true,"Rude in the Good Way explores desire as both subject and method within Roe Ethridge’s complex visual bricolage of commercial glamour, errant snapshots, private sexuality and studio play.

Working through his characteristically oblique, offhand style, Ethridge lets sexuality, identity, seduction and the camera drift into the same plane, never fully separating one from the other. Loosely woven fugues of images converge, always cheekily winking toward something just out of frame: technicolor flash typologies of mouldy peaches, hyper-composite images of Lindsay Lohan, and Chanel still lifes both luxurious and lurid move alongside intimate, dressed-down snapshots of Ethridge’s collaborator Lulu Sylbert, unresolved glimpses into painter John Currin’s erotically charged studio, sarcastic self-portraits, and constant callbacks to the unmistakable image world Ethridge has built over the past twenty years, where photographs refuse to be pinned down or left unstimulated. These fragments ask us, like the title itself, what is rude and what is not. A polished image, a casual glitch, a throwaway snapshot, a luxury still life, a screenshot from a weather station webcam? Ethridge sharpens his polychronic world to a point where desire, consumption and self-presentation overlap so completely that the photographs begin to test our own appetites: what we see, what we want and how we perform. Collaboratively edited by Sarah Chaplin Espenon and the artist, Rude in the Good Way accompanies a solo exhibition at Gagosian Athens, 22 January to 07 March 2026.

You Are What You Do,Daniel Arnold,false,"Arnold’s pursuit of the human moment reveals an artist of emotional range in a city alive with contradiction and complexity.

Loose Joints is proud to present You Are What You Do , a monograph by Daniel Arnold — one of New York’s most renowned and obsessive modern street photographers. Over the past fifteen years, Arnold has become a cult figure in the city’s visual culture, known for his raw, humanistic encounters with its citizens and for collaborations spanning from the Safdie brothers to the Met Gala and beyond.

Rooted in a well-trodden lineage of New York street photography, Arnold’s work channels the chaos, chutzpah, humour and vitality that define the city, yet You Are What You Do reveals something more: a tenderness and empathy that courses through every frame. There are genuine moments of sadness and grief mixed with joy, alongside spontaneous, unscripted scenes of pure street cinema, blended with candid images from fashion shoots and film sets, all sitting effortlessly within Arnold’s generous visual language.

Working from a vast archive, this generous landscape-format monograph distills Arnold’s signature wry, tragicomic style into a spacious and classical book object. From the glamorous heights of high culture to the downtrodden and overlooked, You Are What You Do draws a wide, empathetic circle around New York’s characters and charm.

Daniel Arnold (b. 1980, USA) is a photographer whose candid, street-level images capture the unfiltered rhythms of urban life. Arnold is based in New York and his first monograph, Pickpocket , was published by Elara Press in 2022. His photography regularly appears in publications such as The New York Times, Vogue, and Interview magazine. His recent solo exhibitions include New York Life, New York Life Gallery and New Photographs, Mark Wolfe Contemporary Art, San Francisco.

Slip Me the Master Key,Thomas Prior,false,"Prior’s images of progress, decay and design explore the state of the contemporary world with an eerie clarity.

Loose Joints is proud to announce Slip Me the Master Key , a monograph by Thomas Prior collecting together two decades of the American artist’s precise and unflinching photographic practice.

Prior's sharp images have a connecting thread of the American uncanny, often looking into the bleeding edge of technology, environment, capitalism, and culture to evoke an anthropocentric vision that's sublime in its consistency and composition. Prior’s detailed style moves fluidly between commissioned and personal work to find a subtle dissonance that captures the tremors of Western life at the edge, speaking in their stillness to hidden dynamics of power, change and control in the 21st Century.

In Slip Me the Master Key , Prior’s photographs operate like quiet alarms where messages lurk just below the surface. His subject matter is dizzying: the National Pyrotechnic Festival in Mexico, a quantum supercomputer, a COVID-era morgue truck inauspiciously parked on a Manhattan street corner, empty vats of Adderall, the deepest snow in the world, microplastics, the blood and sweat of a boxer mid-punch, a cloned dog, a strip of land in the Maldives close to being lost to the rising tide. Gathered together and placed in a careful procession, Slip Me the Master Key reveals the strange beauty and charged stillness of a world tipping sideways.

In many ways, this rising tide is the subject of Prior’s constellation of images; the shifts, gradual yet irreversible, that send the world hurtling into a precarious future. Prior’s oblique approach, cool restraint, and curiosity point toward that future, already in motion. Drawing together both the macro forces shaping our world and the minuscule moments that betray its emotional weight, Slip Me the Master Key offers a chilling yet sublime vision of the Anthropocene in which Prior articulates the unspeakable tensions of the present moment.

Thomas Prior (b. 1979, USA) is a photographer whose work blends documentary sensibility with a narrative depth that transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary. Prior is based in New York and works for clients including NASA, The New Yorker, TIME Magazine, and The New York Times, among many others.

The Fold,Hoda Afshar,false,"Through critical reappropriation, Afshar reclaims a colonial photographic legacy fixated on the veiled woman.

The Fold is a critical visual and psychological investigation into the enduring legacy of Orientalist and colonialist photographic practices, and the ways in which these gazes continue to shape how bodies—particularly veiled Islamic bodies—are seen, archived, and consumed.

This new body of work by Iranian artist Hoda Afshar takes as its starting point the vast archive of Gaëtan Gatian de Clérambault (1872–1934), a French psychiatrist and photographer who, in the early 20th century, produced thousands of images of veiled women—and sometimes men—in Morocco. Encountered by Afshar during her research at the musée du quai Branly - Jacques Chirac in Paris, these photographs were originally used by de Clérambault to support psychoanalytic theories around fantasy, covering, and desire, all filtered through a deeply colonial lens.

For the first time in her practice, Afshar engages directly with an archival body of work. Having discovered that the museum’s online archive automatically cropped de Clérambault's images upon downloading, Afshar furthers this degradation into an embedded commentary. By darkroom printing and digitally manipulating these fragments, she ruptures their original intent and transforms them into a space of resistance. Her interventions turn the gaze back on itself—inviting viewers to question the power dynamics woven into the act of looking, and to confront the cultural biases projected onto the veil.

Born after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Afshar came of age in a society where the veil had become a central symbol in the negotiation of political and cultural identity. At the heart of her engagement with the archive is a recognition of how the Islamic female body has long been instrumentalised to serve competing ideologies. While unveiling was used to justify imperial conquest, re-veiling became a symbol of resistance—yet has also been enforced by state authorities for coercive ends. Through the reworking of these colonial images, Afshar navigates this entangled history, forging a third path that critiques both external and internal forms of domination.

This experimental book gathers more than 960 of Afshar’s silver gelatin reappropriations of de Clérambault’s archive, each one a gesture of reworking, refusal, and critical reflection. The Fold includes essays by Ali Behdad and Annabelle Lacour, a conversation between Taous Dahmani and the artist, and is published to accompany Afshar’s solo exhibition Hoda Afshar. Performer l'invisible , at the musée du quai Branly - Jacques Chirac (30/9/2025 – 25/1/2026).

Hoda Afshar (b. 1983, Iran) is an Iranian-born, Melbourne-based artist working across photography, moving image, and installation. She explores themes of violence, marginality, displacement, and representation. In 2023, she held a major institutional survey, A Curve is a Broken Line , at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, which was accompanied by a publication. Her work has been widely exhibited including in: Show it, Grow it! , Museum Folkwang, Essen (2024), NGV Triennial , National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne (2023), Thinking Historically in the Present , Sharjah Biennial 15, Sharjah (2023); STILL ALIVE , Aichi Triennial, Nagoya (2022); and Between the Sun and the Moon , Lahore Biennale, Lahore (2020). Her first monograph, Speak the Wind , was published in 2021 by MACK.

The Last Book,Thomas Prior & Daniel Arnold,false,"The Last Book is the final publication ever printed at die Keure, Bruges, marking the end of 80 years of activity.

In September 2025, one of our most trusted printing partners, die Keure, ceased operations after 80 years of activity. As the photobook world faces mounting production pressures, we wanted to pay tribute to one of Europe’s leading offset printers, who were responsible for dozens of Loose Joints titles.

Printing is a hidden industry — its ingenuity and craft are largely invisible yet indispensable to how photography circulates in book form. At our final session in Bruges, Thomas Prior and Daniel Arnold photographed the presses, the factory floor, and the process behind the printing of their own books ( Slip Me the Master Key and You Are What You Do ). Their images, gathered into a 32-page unbound booklet, are both document and memorial. These sheets were the very last project to run through die Keure’s machines before they were switched off for good on Friday 29 August 2025.

Printed in a strictly limited edition, The Last Book is available exclusively through Loose Joints at bookfairs and in a small online drop of 100 copies. The remaining copies will be given to die Keure’s staff, collaborators and clients.

Daniel Arnold (b. 1980, USA) is a photographer whose candid, street-level images capture the unfiltered rhythms of urban life. Arnold is based in New York and his first monograph, Pickpocket , was published by Elara Press in 2022. His photography regularly appears in publications such as The New York Times, Vogue, and Interview magazine. His recent solo exhibitions include New York Life, New York Life Gallery and New Photographs, Mark Wolfe Contemporary Art, San Francisco.

Thomas Prior (b. 1979, USA) is a photographer whose work blends documentary sensibility with a narrative depth that transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary. Prior is based in New York and works for clients including NASA, The New Yorker, TIME Magazine, and The New York Times, among many others. His previous book with Loose Joints, Amen Break , was published in 2020, and in 2016 he released the book Bomba.

Painted Frames,Malick Sidibé,false,"The iconic Malian photographer's portraits of African modernity are re-framed as intrinsic social and cultural objects.

Loose Joints is honoured to announce Painted Frames , a little-known collection of works by the late Malick Sidibé. Known as the 'Eye of Bamako,' Sidibé documented the lives, style, and energy of post-independence Mali with unparalleled intimacy. His iconic black-and-white photographs, from the exuberant youth of Bamako's dancehalls to the self-assured subjects in his studio, captured a nation defining itself in a moment of profound social and cultural change.

Painted Frames reimagines this legacy, blending Sidibé's hallmark portraits with vivid, hand-painted coloured frames created in collaboration with the artist and local Malian artisans toward the end of Sidibé's life. These frames were not mere embellishments but functional objects — keepsakes and symbols of status, gifted, circulated, cherished and shared. They reflect the joy, pride, and self-expression of Sidibé's subjects, reminding us that his photography was always a social practice first and foremost, designed to celebrate the interconnectedness of African people, culture, and identity.

This late series highlights Sidibé's enduring commitment to celebrating Mali's cultural modernity, emphasising his works as dynamic pieces of social transmission rather than fetishised art objects. By layering painted borders with photographic portraits, Sidibé brought a new richness to his work, amplifying its role as a celebration of social exchange, while also serving as a curatorial gesture in which he gathered together the most important works from his diverse and expansive œuvre into a jubilant burst of colour and affirmation.

Malick Sidibé (1935–2016) was a groundbreaking Malian photographer known for his black-and-white images capturing the vibrancy of post-independence Mali. Through dynamic studio portraits and candid scenes of youth culture from the 1950s to 70s, Sidibé documented Bamako’s nightlife, celebrations, and everyday life with intimacy and energy. His iconic Studio Malick became a cultural landmark, blending traditional aesthetics with modern aspirations. Key publications of his work include Malick Sidibé (Scalo, 1998), Chemises (Steidl, 2007), Malick Sidibé: Photographs (Steidl/The Walther Collection, 2011), and Mali Twist (F ondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain, 2017). In 2007, Sidibé became the first African, and the first photographer, to be awarded the Golden Lion Award for Lifetime Achievement at the Venice Biennale, and he was winner of the Hasselblad Award in 2003.

Notable international exhibitions include Malick Sidibé: Mali Twist at Fondation Cartier pour l’art contemporain, Paris (2017–2018), and Malick Sidibé: The Eye of Modern Mali at Somerset House, London (2016–2017). Sidibé's work has been subject of six solo exhibitions at Jack Shainman Gallery, including Malick Sidibé: LOVE POWER PEACE (2018), Malick Sidibé (2016), and Malick Sidibé: Photographs: 1960–2004 (2005). His photographs are held in collections at The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

The Great Room,Katherine Hubbard,false,"Hubbard uses performance and domestic architecture to explore grief, motherhood, queerness and the labour of caregiving.

Using large-format cameras and experimental darkroom techniques, The Great Room is a profoundly personal series by interdisciplinary artist Katherine Hubbard in collaboration with her mother. In 2020 — a year defined by introspection, caretaking, and the upheaval of the COVID-19 pandemic — Hubbard's mother began experiencing severe memory loss, later diagnosed as LATE, a brain disease mimicking the symptoms of Alzheimer's.

In collaboration with her mother, Hubbard transforms her family home — a space both overwhelming and deeply familiar — into a psychological landscape. These cluttered rooms become a layered stage where her mother serves as partner in an ongoing exploration of the real and performed. Together, they create photographs that engage with daily rituals such as bathing, organising, and watching TV: compositions that blend seamlessly with unguarded intimacy. This photographic series ruptures the quotidian in an exploration of care work, memory, grief, and the entropy of loss.

Hubbard’s practice pushes against the flattening of the photographic image, critically engaging performance, sculptural elements, and the implicit power dynamics in the social contract between the photographer and her subject. This is the first time Hubbard has consistently photographed another person. Here, photography becomes more than documentation; it is an entanglement of touch and gesture; the domestic and the maternal; which confront the pain of losing the familiar essence of her mother. In addition Hubbard creates experimental body contact prints in the darkroom with her mother that trace the textures of skin and the physicality of aging. These tactile works materialise ability and the weight of time, celebrating the complexity of their relationship while questioning the roles of artist, subject, and collaborator. In The Great Room , Hubbard reimagines the home as a space where photography transforms care and the slow grief of dementia into a powerful act of presence and love.

Katherine Hubbard (b. 1981, USA) is an interdisciplinary artist whose work bridges photography, performance, and text. Her practice explores analogue photography as an embodied process, using it to examine social politics, history, and narrative. Her book a slight cast down at the edges of the lips was published by Capricious in 2023, and she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2024. Hubbard holds an MFA from the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts at Bard College and is currently an Associate Professor of Art and MFA Graduate Director at Carnegie Mellon University. Hubbard is represented by Company Gallery . Hubbard’s solo exhibitions include Avoid glancing blows at Company Gallery; Katherine Hubbard at Higher Pictures; stages at Baxter St. Camera Club of New York; and Bring your own lights at The Kitchen. Her work has been featured in group exhibitions such as Time Management Techniques at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Ecstatic Land at Ballroom, Marfa, Texas; The Artist’s Museum at ICA Boston; and Greater New York at MoMA PS1. Hubbard’s performances have been presented at the Chinati Foundation, Konstfack in Stockholm, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum.

The Classroom,Hicham Benohoud,false,"The Classroom explores control and discipline within post-colonial Moroccan identity through staged, uncanny classroom images created between 1994 and 2002.

Frustrated by Morocco’s rigid educational system of the 1990s, art teacher Hicham Benohoud used photography as a pedagogical tool, creating a makeshift darkroom in his classroom to foster collaborative and hands-on learning, encouraging students to engage with creativity and identity.

The resulting images created with his students are marked by tension and alienation, blending absurdity, humour, and unease in their exquisitely framed and obliquely disarming compositions. In juxtaposing the monotony of the classroom with a visual exploration of both freedom and control, The Classroom builds a playful and existential critique of postcolonial identity, where childlike creative gestures merge into a more ambiguous aesthetic that hints at oppression, violence and isolation.

This new publication by Loose Joints draws from the artist's original archive of negatives from the time, building the first comprehensive appraisal of Benohoud’s ground-breaking series while highlighting the modern relevance of the work in its engagement with performance, politics, pedagogy and the body decades ahead of its time.

Hicham Benohoud (b. 1968, Marrakech) is a Moroccan visual artist whose innovative photography blends elements of painting and performance to explore identity politics and power relations. Frequently incorporating his own body as a subject, his practice is characterized by staged, constructed imagery, as seen in his acclaimed series La Salle de Classe ( The Classroom ) and Azemmour . A graduate of the École Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Strasbourg, Benohoud's work transforms everyday objects into unsettling, thought-provoking compositions. Benohoud has published two monographs — La Salle de Classe (Les éditions de l'œil, 2001) and Des Lycéens par Eux-mêmes (Les éditions de l'œil, 2002) — and contributed to significant collective photography books, including La Photographie Contemporaine (Scala, 2009) and The Body in Contemporary Art (Thames & Hudson, 2009). His work has been exhibited internationally at the Centre Pompidou, Palais de Tokyo, and Hayward Gallery, and features in prestigious collections such as Tate Modern and Fonds National d’Art Contemporain. He has received numerous accolades, including Prix Photo Service Prize in Arles and the Prix Visa pour la Création, awarded by Cultures France.

Bravo,Felipe Romero Beltrán,false,"Identity and geography intersect in Romero Beltrán's conceptual poetics of suspended time and human resilience on the US-Mexico border.

Bravo situates itself in the liminal space of the Rio Bravo, a site of perpetual tension and migration where identity and geography intersect. Focusing on a 270-kilometre stretch of the river, Romero Beltrán’s Bravo constructs an elusive visual narrative where the river itself becomes a silent protagonist, shaping the lives of those who approach it but rarely appearing in the frame. Through stark portraits, austere interiors, and scarred landscapes, Bravo captures the suspended time of migration as his subjects wait, sometimes for years, in the shadow of an uncertain crossing.

Romero Beltrán's signature style is precise in the pursuit of a political reality, where meticulously produced portraiture both reveals and conceals the resilience, exhaustion and hope of the migrant experience, alongside the muted delicacy of Romero Beltrán's interiors, where a speaker, a mattress, a red-painted table become loaded with symbolic weight.

Divided into three chapters— Endings , Bodies , and Breaches —Romero Beltrán’s inscrutable documentary approach challenges the semiotics of classification, enclosure, definition, and identification in his visual aesthetics that mirror the suppressed and controlled notions of identity at the border. Also included within Bravo is El Cruce , an audiovisual work that underscores the river’s dual role as a life source and militarized boundary through scenes of baptism, fishing, and migrant stories. With accompanying texts by Salvadoran migrant Dominick Bermúdez, thinker Albert Corbí, and artist Alejandra Aragón, as well as an interview with the artist, Bravo is an urgent and poetic meditation on a border defined by contradictions—where hope, despair, movement, and stillness converge.

Felipe Romero Beltrán (b. 1992) is a Colombian photographer based in Paris. Beltrán focuses on social issues, dealing with the tension that new narratives introduce in the field of documentary photography. His practice, characterized by its interest in social matters, is the result of long-term projects accompanied by extensive research on the subject.

Passé Présent Futur: the Fondation d’entreprise Hermès Artists' Residencies curated by Emmanuelle Luciani,,false,"Craftsmanship, fine art and publishing converge in an unprecedented collaboration between Emmanuelle Luciani and Fondation d’entreprise Hermès.

Loose Joints is proud to announce Passé Présent Futur , a groundbreaking collaboration between Fondation d’entreprise Hermès, curator Emmanuelle Luciani, and Loose Joints Publishing. Contributing to the Fondation d’entreprise Hermès' prestigious Artists' Residencies series, this new chapter sees Luciani inviting four artists—Jenna Kaës, Mounir Ayache, Salomé Chatriot, and Jacopo Pagin—into the heart of Hermès’ production ateliers.

Under Luciani’s visionary curatorship, each residency dissolves the boundary between classical craft and contemporary myth-making. Her distinctive interdisciplinary ethos as founder of Marseille-based Southway Studio infuses the program with a spirit that is both reverent of the past and alive to the present. Each artist has been invited to engage deeply with the savoir-faire of Hermès artisans working in silk, leather, crystal and metal—resulting in wholly new artistic gestures shaped by the material logic of the atelier.

Anchored by a newly commissioned photographic series by Brazilian photographer Marcelo Gomes, whose sensuous, textural images follow each artist at work and mirror the tactility of process, the publication also includes further contributions by French photographer Tadzio, a Fondation d’entreprise Hermès long-term partner, skilled in capturing crafts and material through a sensitive approach. Through these images, alongside interviews with the artists and the artisans who supported them, Passé Présent Futur emerges as a singular, experimental book object offering a deconstructed lens into the process of making.

About Emmanuelle Luciani:

Emmanuelle Luciani (b. 1986) is a curator, artist and artistic director based in Marseille. In 2018, Luciani founded Southway Studio , a collaborative artistic ecosystem housed in Pavillon Southway , a domestic exhibition space and residency in Marseille opened in 2020, hosting visual artists, musicians and writers.

Her hybrid exhibitions and performances – including Cool as a State of Mind (2015), Pre-Capital (2017, with Nicolas Bourriaud), Les Chemins du Sud (2019), Anima Mundi (2020), Drive to Survive (2022), Bella’s Inferno (2024), and Amleth13 (2025) – draw on wide-ranging references: funerary sculpture, custom car culture, football, Romanticism, the Pre-Raphaelites, and vernacular craft traditions. Working across disciplinary boundaries, Luciani creates what she terms “time bubbles” – immersive visual worlds in which historical and contemporary forms are collapsed into speculative, symbolic tableaux.

About Fondation d’entreprise Hermès:

Since 2008, the actions of the Fondation d’entreprise Hermès have been guided by a single, unifying conviction: “Our gestures define us and show who we are”. In other words, by acting for the well-being of all, we grow and become better human beings. The Foundation’s four core missions enact its commitment to targeted philanthropy and support through in-house programmes designed to transmit skills and expertise, create new works of art, protect the environment and encourage gestures of solidarity. The Foundation supports its beneficiaries as they contribute to building tomorrow's world.

Office / LA Office,Lars Tunbjörk,false,"Tunbjörk's iconic 2001 photobook of corporate melancholy is re-published in a luxurious slipcased edition, alongside an exclusive, unreleased series.

Loose Joints is honoured to announce the posthumous re-publication of Office by legendary Swedish photographer Lars Tunbjörk, alongside the release of LA Office – an unpublished series completed shortly before his passing. Tunbjörk's iconic series from the turn of the 21st century delves into the bureaucracy, disorder, and mundanity of office culture with masochistic delight, capturing the soul-sapping environments of corporate spaces with unparalleled insight.

Over five years, Tunbjörk explored offices across Stockholm, New York, and Tokyo, photographing 'like an alien' in the soulless, banal uniformity of these workplaces. He sought to capture that lingering sadness in what he called ""the most common – but closed and secretive – place in the Western world."" While the winds of change may have transformed the grey dividers into WeWork couches or the clunky dialup PC into a sleek, pocketable touchscreen tablet, Tunbjörk's images capture a contingent sense of ennui and isolation still prescient in an era of bullshit jobs, quiet quitting and working from home.

This two-volume series is redesigned by Tunbjörk's close collaborator, graphic designer and art director Greger Ulf Nilson. Nilson reworks his original 2001 design of Office , presenting a fresh perspective alongside a separate book of unseen works in LA Office, both housed in a slipcase . The book is published in collaboration with Lars Tunbjörk Foundation .

Lars Tunbjörk (1956–2015) was a celebrated Swedish photographer born in Borås, Sweden. Tunbjörk started as a prominent press photographer in Stockholm, working for The New York Times, Liberation, GEO, Times and he was a member of Galerie and Agence VU’. Tunbjörk published about a dozen books, with notable works including Office (Journal/Max Strom, 2001), Home (Steidl, 2002), and Vinter (Steidl, 2007). His photographs are held in prestigious collections at Moderna Museet in Stockholm, the Maison Européenne de la Photographie in Paris, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Throughout his career, Tunbjörk received numerous accolades, including Photographer of the Year by Sweden's Pressfotografernas Klubb, First Prize at the World Press Photo, and the 2008 Scanpix Award. Lars Tunbjörk passed away suddenly in 2015. His work continues to inspire and influence the world of photography.

Hardtack,Rahim Fortune,false,"Fortune uplifts the long-enduring nature of Black culture and traditions in the American South across ten years of portraiture rooted in history and the landscape.

Flour, water, and salt. These are the sole ingredients that make Hardtack: a Civil War-era food long-associated with survivalism, land migration, and its extremely long shelf life. Drawing from this history as a metaphor for the long-enduring nature of Black culture and traditions, Hardtack uncovers the roots that tie Fortune's native landscape to the conflicts and nuances associated with the post-emancipation Americas.

In the follow-up to his breakout monograph I can't stand to see you cry , Fortune borrows from the language of vernacular and archival photography to interrogate the historical relationship of his community to photography; rooted in the landscape, Fortune often uses sites of historical and cultural interest as a guide but not a subject, implying the deep ties that bind modern Black communities resiliently to their regions, in the face of both adversity and joy. A significant theme in Hardtack is Fortune’s striking portraits of coming-of-age traditions. Inside, young bull-riders, praise dancers, and pageant queens inherit and gracefully embrace these forms of community ritual. Fortune's dignifying eye pays tribute to these cultural performances' rigour, discipline and creative flair, alongside the intergenerational conversation between young people and elders handing down these traditions. Collecting together nearly a decade of work, Hardtack continues Fortune’s weaving of documentary and personal history, marking a sincere expression of love and passion to a region that has nourished the artist personally and creatively, while also marking an important contribution to photographing the American South.

Rahim Fortune is a visual artist and educator from the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma. He uses photography to ask fundamental questions about American identity. Focusing on the narratives of individual families and communities, he explores shifting geographies of migration and resettlement and the way that these histories are written on the landscapes of Texas and the American South. Fortune’s previous book, I can’t stand to see you cry , was published by Loose Joints in 2021, and was the winner of the Rencontres d'Arles Louis Roederer Discovery Award 2022. His work has been featured in exhibitions worldwide and many permanent collections, including the High Museum in Atlanta, GA, LUMA Arles, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and The Boston Museum of Fine Art.

Impossible Island,Henry Roy,true,"Henry Roy blends dream, observation, imagination, and poetic resistance in a career survey spanning four decades.

Loose Joints is proud to present the first monograph exploring forty years of innovative Franco-Haitian artist Henry Roy's sublime photographic practice. Published in collaboration with the Art Gallery of Western Australia (AGWA), Impossible Island brings together photography, text, and video to immerse readers in Roy's world of interconnected dreams, where time, place, and memory flow together.

Roy’s works, spanning his native Haiti, France, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Thailand, Tunisia, and beyond, build a photographic worldview influenced by French modernism, New Wave aesthetics, creolization, and Haitian spiralisme . Through his sun-kissed style and animistic sensibility, Roy grants agency to all forms of life, creating transcendent moments that transcend time and place. His images evoke layered narratives that reject imperialist frameworks, inviting viewers to linger, embrace wonder, and explore the boundaries of the visible, rich with poetic and philosophical depth.

Impossible Island delicately sequences Roy's career of refined images into a kind of open-ended story- telling, accompanied by evocative, poetic texts by the artist and an essay by curator Robert Cook to redefine as a relational and transformative force, offering an enduring vision of interconnectedness and renewal

Roy’s career survey Henry Roy – Impossible Island draws on 40-years of recollections and observations, bringing together 113 photos taken from 1983-2023 at The Art Gallery of Western Australia, 30 November 2024–18 May 2025.

Henry Roy was born in 1963 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti and moved to Paris with his family at the age of three where he has remained. He studied photography in Paris and has been active since the early 1980s. Roy’s work has been published in major international journals such as Vogue Paris, Purple Journal, Purple Fashion, Air France Magazine, AD, W Magazine, Harper's Bazaar UK, Artreview, M Le Monde, L'Officiel Voyage, Apartamento, Hobo, and IntranQu'îllités. He has produced six artist books since 1998.

Días,Pia Riverola,false,"Spanish photographer Pia Riverola's sun-drenched images evoke the rhythm of a day in an effortless series of vignettes from around the world.

Loose Joints is excited to present Días , a tonal collage of places and days by Spanish photographer Pia Riverola. Renowned for her evocative, hazy imagery, the delicately-sequenced Días uses motion, blur, and dappled light to create a sensory and synaesthetic experience, transporting you to a memory long-forgotten, plucked from time. Riverola's dreamy images, soaked in atmosphere, evoke feelings of distance and travel: from neon-lit rainy Japanese nights, a Mediterranean breeze lifting a Spanish tablecloth, or Italian drizzle softly falling beneath an umbrella in a Roman garden.

A self-taught photographer, Riverola's images contain a casual offhandedness; candid like an overheard conversation, intimated and muffled like a late-night call with a friend, celebratory and in wonder of the world. As if peeling away the layers, the days of toil and tribulation to see the world anew, Días feels cleansing and deep in its essence, joyful yet sombre in the way Riverola's oblique evocations roll away before your eyes. With Días , Riverola continues to explore her passion for capturing the essence of place, inviting readers to immerse themselves in the poetic beauty of her journeys.

Pia Riverola (b. 1989) is a Spanish photographer currently based between Los Angeles and Mexico City. A self-taught photographer, Riverola's work is a rich tapestry of place and texture, where her skilful use of colour, composition, and obscurity creates engaging renderings of her subjects. Riverola's diverse portfolio includes fashion, still life, landscape, and architectural photography. Notable clients and editorials include Calvin Klein, LVMH, Balenciaga, Apple, Belmond, Loewe, Apartamento Magazine, M le Monde, The Wall Street Journal, and Vogue. Recent exhibitions include Photo London, Homecoming Gallery in Amsterdam and Jo-hs Gallery in Mexico City. Her first book, Flechazo , was published in 2022 and sold out within three months.

Caspian: A Southern Reflection,Khashayar Javanmardi,false,"Javanmardi’s activist approach to photography blends the melancholy of climate anxiety with classical documentary, along the shores of the world’s largest enclosed body of water.

The Caspian Sea is bounded by Iran on the South, Russia on the North, Azerbaijan on the West, and Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan on the East. Growing up on the shores of the Caspian Sea, Iranian photographer Khashayar Javanmardi witnessed the once-abundant lake fall victim to unregulated exploitation, pollution, overfishing, and climate change, creating a toxic cocktail that impoverishes those who depend on its diminishing returns. Every year, approximately 122,000 tons of pollutants from the Caspian coastal states, including oil pollution, domestic and industrial sewage, pollute the marine environment, endangering other species.

The first part of an ongoing project mapping the region, Javanmardi's images of the Iranian shores of the Caspian visualise the environmental crisis, portraying the lives of local inhabitants whose existence becomes smaller and poorer as the sea deteriorates. Industrial waste, sewage, and pollutants from commercial fleets have severely impacted aquatic life, threatening food security and causing significant economic losses. The fishing rate has plummeted by 70% in recent years, profoundly affecting local fishermen’s livelihoods.

As he travels along the Caspian Sea, Javanmardi documents the human connection with this environment, as well as the efforts of nature to survive under immense pressure. Javanmardi’s documentary approach is both lyrical and urgent, boldly and confidently harmonising between atmospheric, sublime visual poetry of life along the shore and stark, documentary witnessing of a dire environmental present. In this respect, Caspian appeals to the urgent need for reconciling these two narratives in order to effectively tackle climate change: the incorporation of the political, systemic, and structural into the experience, agency, and activism of everyday lived experience.

Khashayar Javanmardi (b. 1991) is a Persian lens-based artist from Iran whose evocative work explores the intricate relationships between nature, culture, and identity. Growing up along the shorelines of Iran has profoundly influenced his artistic vision. Currently based in Lausanne, Switzerland, his reflections on his homeland reveal the contradictions inherent in communicating themes of culture and global politics, portraying a personal narrative of devastation and longing.

Javanmardi has been working as a photojournalist since the age of 19 with Jam Photo Agency, and his documentary work has been published in newspapers and publications worldwide. Javanmardi is also the founder and director of Hayaat Art Space. In 2023, Javanmardi was shortilsted and received the special jury mention for the prestigious Prix Elysée, was a winner of the Un/Fund Award 2023, and recently won second Prize for the PhMuseum 2024 Photography Grant.

Rotting from Within,Abdulhamid Kircher,false,"Kircher explores identity, patriarchy, trauma and reconciliation in a diaristic project between Berlin and Turkey.

Rotting from Within refers to a feeling described by Abdulhamid Kircher upon the unearthing of his father’s history: the discovery of the generational trauma within the patriarchs of his family and the subsequent task of uncovering the artist’s self amongst the things passed down. Beginning at the age of seventeen with the reacquaintance of his estranged father, recently released from incarceration for selling drugs and attempted murder, Kircher’s self-led journey into photography coincided with a reflection on his past. Born in Berlin and fleeing to the USA at a young age, the camera provided an entry point for intimacy and familiarity with his father and his Turkish culture and heritage while fostering a deep relationship with the photographic medium and its possibilities. Rotting from Within weaves a deeply personal, autobiographical thread with photographic vigour and candidness as we penetrate deeper into the psychological questions of identity, the glorification of violence, the myths of masculinity and the veil through which photography provides a mechanism to cope and understand the world. Kircher’s threaded visual voice speaks at the intersection of an internal monologue and a nuanced approach to documentary; through complex assemblages of portraiture, observation, archival documents, diaries and more, Rotting from Within contains visual webs of association within which Kircher captures the tension between speculation and reality, the inherent unknowability of even those closest at hand, and how we do not get to choose the life into which we are born.

Abdulhamid Kircher (b. 1996) is an artist from Queens, New York. He was born in Berlin to German and Turkish parents, and immigrated with his mother to the United States at the age of eight. His work is a living archive of place and people, as it is also a dedication to the language of photography, the mechanics and aesthetic possibilities of the form. He received his BA in Culture and Media from The New School in 2018 and his MFA in Visual Arts from the University of California San Diego in 2022. Abdul currently lives and works between Berlin, Germany and Los Angeles, California.

Workbooks,Nigel Shafran,false,"Shafran's endlessly creative hand scribbles a life of photographic notes and observations, with his signature blend of simplicity, profundity, and wit.

Loose Joints is proud to present Workbooks : an extensive book that gathers together a creative lifetime of c ollecting, imagining, sketching and recording by British artist Nigel Shafran from 1984-2024. Below, writer David Chandler reflects on Shafran's Workbooks :

Books have been the principal means through which Nigel Shafran’s photographic work has become known. He understands the gift of their materiality and he has invested heavily in how his books look and in how they are made. But Shafran’s investment in book making is also integral to the way he builds his ideas and projects. It is ingrained in a process that sees his photographs, soon after they are made, printed, edited and stuck into the pages of bound volumes that are part workbook, part diary, part aide-memoire. These working documents are informal books, but, partly in preparation for decisions that will later define the actual publications, they are carefully assembled and richly embellished. Each is filled with drawings, notes and bits of everyday ephemera as well as photographs, and each has a particular aesthetic, with an easy feeling for material craft as well as visual simplicity and clarity that is characteristic of Shafran’s intuitive organising principles and his entire working process. – David Chandler

Nigel Shafran (b. 1964) is a British photographer known for his contemplative, domestic and humanistic approach to photography, notably in book form.

A House of Clay,Erik Gustafsson,false,"The birdsong of everyday life interacts with cycles of darkroom creation and destruction in Gustafsson's expressive monograph.

In A House of Clay , Gustafsson places his conceptual and contextual photographic process in dialogue with a simple premise, a truism of photography: to elevate the everyday, to find meaning and take seriously the smallest of occurrences in ordinary life, and to invoke a sense of gratitude and wonder toward consciousness, sensing and feeling. Sometimes excessively normal, elsewhere tender and intimate, later dense and complex, Gustafsson's warm slices of life are digested in the darkroom, where the technical processes of photography fall in on themselves, becoming embedded in the image: cycles of photographing, printing, failing, dodging rules, repeating and scanning. Balancing consciousness and coincidence, Gustafsson's moments of magical realism speak of a permanence, a perpetual present, where the continually unfinished image can always be, at a later stage, altered, manipulated — and rewritten. In A House of Clay , even the finality of the printed page is punctured; images flip and rotate across the page, sequences accumulate and stack up heady with visual (dis)association, only to dissolve and fold, the print submerged again in the chemicals, the house of clay reshaped again.

Erik Gustafsson (b. 1987) is a photographer and print-maker living in Gothenburg, Sweden. Through montages of photographs of people, places, things and abstract pictures, his work revolves as much around mirroring life itself, as it does around the open interpretation of the meaning of images. After receiving his MFA from HDK-Valand in Gothenburg, Gustafsson’s work has been exhibited internationally and he has previously published two books; Pause Between Thought and Action (self-published, 2022) and This is Farewell (Heavy Books, 2020).

Dialect,Felipe Romero Beltrán,false,"The poetics of documentary, performance, and choreography combine to politically interrogate the dead time of bureaucracy for young migrants stuck in the Spanish legal system.

Dialect covers three years of state violence for nine young Moroccan migrants exiled in Kafka-esque limbo in Seville, southern Spain. When underage migrants enter the country illegally and cannot be verified as adults, their custody remains in the hands of the state – subjecting them to a lengthy process of up to three years to gain legal status.

In this state of suspension and liminality, Beltrán engages with the body as a metaphor: using a carefully articulated language between photography, performance and collaboration, the weight of dead time is registered upon the shoulders of these young men, entering into dialogue with their memories, journeys, and the humiliating mundanity of waiting and migration. Alongside video works and choreographed dance, Dialect breaks new documentary ground to shine a critical light on practices of bureaucratic oppression.

Felipe Romero Beltrán (b. 1992) is a Colombian photographer based in Madrid, Spain. Beltrán focuses on social issues, dealing with the tension that new narratives introduce in the field of documentary photography. His practice, characterized by its interest in social matters, is the result of long-term projects accompanied by extensive research on the subject. Beltrán is currently completing a PhD in photography at the Complutense University of Madrid. His series Dialect is the winner of the 2022 Aperture Portfolio Prize.

Notwithstanding,Hudson Hayden,false,"The grammar of photography and the invisible design of observed life meet in a sequence of exquisitely crafted microcosms.

Canadian artist Hudson Hayden's photographic practice crafts a delicately articulated language that plucks and punctures photographic categories. From the romance of stillness and space to shaky articulations of capitalist experience, Notwithstanding articulates itself as a laconic series of speech acts, steeped in o ff - kilter humour, askew optimism, and a love for the visual medium.

This series of precisely-crafted images began in 2016, with Hayden's move to Europe. Photographing instinctively, Hayden touches the well-worn grooves of contemporary image culture: from the intersection of photography with semiotics, the inferred distortion of narrative through sequencing photographs together, and how everyday objects can become icons simply by being photographed. Hayden's visual lexicon is akin to one of design; forms and their thingness are collapsed in on the photographic plane, becoming shapes that dance, as much a game of memory and fun as a loftier space of visual poetry.

Hayden's title, Notwithstanding , also speaks to the indeterminate and the inarticulable within his photographs. Images that often describe something simple – a dog, a ball, a boat on a lake, or an orange in a bowl – can feel curiously other, despite themselves, or in spite of their clear referents. Hayden quotes photographic genres with a laconic wit: from the Ghirrian coolness of early postmodern colour photography, to the sanitised language of advertising and commercial image-making, and through compositions that harmonise in both their immediate accessibility and their inherent unknowability.

Hudson Hayden (b. 1986 Canada) is a Canadian photographer currently based in Berlin, Germany. His work is characterised by a detailed approach to photography, and a signature dry wit. His work has been published and exhibited internationally.

Somewhere 2017-2023,Sam Youkilis,false,"Sam Youkilis's immediate and generous indexing of everyday life reaches across space and time in his debut monograph – a 528-page typology of human experience.

Sam Youkilis has been building a continuous archive of photographic works through his phone for the last six years. Working instinctively, Youkilis's short, immersive videos gather universal themes of human experience, using the casual language of the cameraphone to evoke something profound, anthropological, comprehensive and yet incomplete. Youkilis’s work springs from an attitude, a way of experiencing the world, that contains depth beyond the o ff hand ease in which his images freely circulate.

In Youkilis’s first publication, the depth of this engagement with human patterns of behaviour is archived and scattered across a diverse range of themes, divided into chapters that playfully tease the tensions between categorisation and chance that inform his observational works. Made exclusively of video stills, Somewhere scours Youkilis’s database for images of everything from the time of day–7:07AM, 12:33PM—to unmade beds, the act of cutting, thresholds, dancing couples and gestures of romance.

Presented as a dense 500-page sequence, Somewhere activates the archive and the typology as a source of human joy and communion while emboldening his subjects and unlocking the deep essence of di ff erent places worldwide. Youkilis embraces the real by engaging with both ephemerality and sincerity, while steeped in reverence for the photographic medium through a meticulous engagement with composition, colour, chiaroscuro and framing.

Sam Youkilis (b. 1993, New York) is a documentary photographer and filmmaker based in Italy.

Dream About Nothing,Bobby Doherty,false,"Acclaimed still-life photographer Doherty pushes his precise visual language to a place of inarticulation and unconscious association, in a bold sequence of singular image arrangements, rhymed and bonded together.

Individually, Bobby Doherty’s photographs are quite clear. In front of you, a flower, a drinks can, a courgette, next an alloy wheel. But collectively their meanings become distorted. A photo of a popsicle carries a different weight once it is opposite a battered butterfly. But what are you meant to be looking at? Doherty's images attempt to overwhelm the viewer with questions about what we consider mundane, and what we view as special, in order to ask a greater question: one that transcends “why this over that” but instead, “why anything at all?”

In Dream About Nothing , Doherty embarks on a more introspective articulation of his remarkably consistent visual practice. He invites us to pull back from the visually-tumbling-image-overload language that much of contemporary still-life and observational photography relents itself to, instead placing, with utmost care and precision, a line of observed things and places before your eyes. What does it all mean?

Doherty takes this question more seriously than the serotonin colours and satisfying framing of his images may suggest. Across five years of continuously photographing within and without the studio, Doherty rhymes images into a place where their categories break down, stripping away much of the warmer language of his previous book, Seabird . These pictures ask us to feel, albeit somewhat uncomfortably, the essence of a photographic voice, pulling at the seams of visual categories, asking both more and less of us from each photograph. From the big to the small, the broken to the pristine, Dream About Nothing shows Bobby Doherty making magic, as he rushes to the next photograph, waiting for you to turn the next page.

The Well,Nigel Shafran,false,"In the world of fashion, 'The well' is industry terminology for the main image section of a magazine. For influential British photographer Nigel Shafran, this space has served as a place for unexpected creativity, subversive critique and wry commentary.

Shafran’s relationship with the world of commercial photography begins in the mid-1980s as a teenager, continuing through to the iconic magazine years of i-D and The Face , and into a recent resurgence in his idiosyncratic, unpretentious approach to the fashion shoot within the pages of Vogue and more. Only recently did Shafran — who is known for his delicate, personal approach of weaving together converging photographic narratives — begin to understand his continuous engagement with the commercial world as a project in itself. The Well is a space to critique and reflect the worlds of fashion from the inside, bringing his trademark simplicity and capacity to disarm the viewer into this charged, complicated world. This landmark publication, edited and designed by Linda van Deursen, chronicles Shafran’s commercial and un-commercial approach to photography, with interviews and reflections between Shafran and his peers threaded throughout.

Nigel Shafran (b. 1964) is a British photographer known for his contemplative, domestic and humanistic approach to photography, notably in book form. Previous publications include Ruthbook (1995), Dad's Office (1999), Edited Photographs 1992-2004 (Steidl/Photoworks, 2004), Flowers for ___ (Koenig, 2008), Ruth on the Phone (Roma, 2012) Teenage Precinct Shoppers (Dashwood, 2013) Visitor Figures (2015) Dark Rooms (MACK, 2016) and The People On The Street (2018). His work has been included in exhibitions such as How we are; Photographing Britain , Tate Britain; Observers: Photographers of the British Scene from the 1930’s to Now , Galeria de Arte SESI Sao Paulo, Brazil; Island stories: Fifty Years of Photography in Britain , Victoria & Albert Museum; Reality Check , Photographer’s Gallery / British Council; Theatres of the Real , FotoMuseum, Antwerp. His work is held in several public collections, including Museum for Moderne Kunst Frankfurt, Arts Council, the National Portrait Gallery and the Victoria & Albert Museum.

Companions,Yana Wernicke,false,"Wernicke documents with subtle grace the close bonds between two young women and the farm animals that they rescue, love, play with and care for, in a series mixing German romanticism and modern ethics.

John Berger’s landmark Why Look at Animals? describes the ‘species loneliness’ of modern man: how the ancient relationships between humans and nature have broken down, reducing the existence of animals to marginalised objects, as commodities, and as Other. Concerned with modern humanity’s yearning for a deeper connection to ecology, Wernicke’s series is a touching portrait of two young women who have established profound relationships with animals. Rosina and Julie each independently save animals from certain death and create bonds of love and trust with animals typically considered solely for their economic value.

In German, Companions , or Weggefährten , is a hybrid word that translates literally as ‘those who walk the path together’. Through tenderness, touch and intuition, Wernicke’s camera follows that path – of joy, emotions, tenderness and play between humans and animals – striving to close the gulf between our emotional consciousness and those of the other animals we live alongside.

Yana Wernicke (b. 1990) is a German photographer currently based in a small town close to Frankfurt am Main. Her work often revolves around the photographic depiction of animals and humankind’s relationship to nature and other beings. Recent publications include Zenker (Edition Patrick Frey, 2021) in collaboration with Jonas Feige, which addresses the history of German colonialism in Cameroon.

O,Luis Alberto Rodriguez,false,"Mysticism, spirituality and corporeal liberation meet in the studio for Rodriguez’s powerful new series exploring control, purity and identity.

In O. , acclaimed Dominican-American artist Luis Alberto Rodriguez strips down his choreographed, embodied approach to photography through a series that explores the free-fall of life, the construction of identity, and their connections with spiritual destiny. Influenced by French mystic thinker Simone Weil, Rodriguez draws a line between his stripped-down portraits and Weil’s life’s work, in search of purity and the relationship between suffering and transcendence. The title of the book – the letter O – speaks to this transcendence – between a noise, a gasp, an exhale, a cycle, all sounds, an open symbol, a zero, a reset.

Using a cast of different bodies, ages, backgrounds and identities, Rodriguez sculpts a series of nudes oscillating between power and a loss of control. Rodriguez challenges his subjects to let go: bodies contort and collapse while returning to poise, lifting to grace, and reaching into purity. How much control do we have over the direction we are headed? How soft is the landing?

Rodriguez frames his striking nudes in dialogue with images of tasseography – the practice of divination through coffee-cup reading that runs through Rodriguez’s Dominican heritage – to spiritually engage with the force and beauty of those who appear, and disappear, before his camera. O. envokes the volatility of our current moment, our states of self-preservation, and the future that is yet to come.

Dominican-American artist Luis Alberto Rodriguez trained as a dancer at The Juilliard School, performing worldwide for fifteen years before turning to photography. Now, he continues to study the human form’s movement, often using his subject’s body sculpturally and abstractly. In 2017, Rodriguez won both the Prix de Public and the American Vintage Prize at the 32nd Hyères Festival of Fashion and Photography. Rodriguez’s previous book, People of the Mud , was published by Loose Joints in 2020 and looks at cultural heritage in Wexford, Ireland.

A Perfect Sentence,Oliver Frank Chanarin,false,"Chanarin explores the drive for attention, the complexity of being seen and the anxiety of being overlooked, in photographic encounters across Britain.

Oliver Frank Chanarin 's practice has long pushed against the edges of the photographic medium to interrogate dynamics of power and visibility, and challenge the ethics of documentary photography. Following the dissolution of the twenty-year creative partnership Broomberg & Chanarin, the artist's first solo project returns to an origin point: using the camera and the photographic encounter to speak towards, penetrate, and critique our lived experience. Drawing as much from August Sander as W. G. Sebald, Chanarin's photographic wanderings and auto-fictional experiments engage with the artist's subjectivity while querying the slippery terrain of documentary photography.

Chanarin often finds himself on the margins — from suburban fetish clubs to accident-faking ambulance chasers, or from amateur dramatics groups in church halls to gender activists protesting in the streets. In a country fragmented by political polarisation, pandemic isolation and the weaponisation of identity politics, Chanarin attempts to reconcile the eccentricity of Britishness with the pressing need for new forms of representation.

Like Chanarin's previous projects, A Perfect Sentence crisscrosses the line between discipline and chance: organised collaborative photoshoots with institutional partners give way to chance encounters with strangers and friends, missteps and wilful attempts at getting lost in the world, chaos in the darkroom, and self-critical texts. Chanarin refuses the authority of a final image, often choosing to present in-progress darkroom prints that show the processes of correction, redaction and selection, the images refusing to resolve themselves. The Sisyphean and futile task of distilling a country onto the page becomes grist for the mill as Chanarin's candid images — sometimes uncomfortable and disquieting, elsewhere bucolically British — accrue and coagulate, like thick piled slabs of buttered toast.

Commissioned and produced by Forma in collaboration with eight UK organisations, A Perfect Sentence culminates in a series of regional exhibitions, in which the series is presented in different iterations: from framed works continuously mounted and unmounted from the gallery walls by a robotic arm trained to respond to patterns of audience attention, to a suite of screenprints, to outdoor poster exhibitions.

Oliver Frank Chanarin (b. 1971) is an artist working primarily with photography. His work, though borne out of photography and a critical appropriation of photojournalism, culminates in different media including books, installation, sculpture and photography. Chanarin studied Artificial Intelligence as an undergraduate and held the position of Professor of Photography at the Hochschule für bildende Künste (HFBK) in Hamburg (2016-2022), and is also a founding member of the Masters programme in photography at The Royal Academy of Art (KABK) in The Netherlands. Chanarin is one half of the duo Broomberg & Chanarin, whose work is held in major public and private collections including Pompidou, Tate, MoMA, Yale, Stedelijk, Jumex in Mexico DF, Victoria and Albert Museum, the Art Gallery of Ontario, Cleveland Museum of Art and Baltimore Museum of Art. Awards include the ICP Infinity Award (2014), the Deutsche Börse Photography Prize (2013) and the Arles Photo-Text Award (2018). Previous publications by Broomberg & Chanarin include Ghetto (Trolley, 2003), Fig. (Steidl/Photoworks, 2007), People in Trouble Laughing Pushed to the Ground (MACK, 2011), War Primer 2 (MACK, 2011/2018), and Holy Bible (MACK / AMC, 2013).

I can’t stand to see you cry,Rahim Fortune,false,"""A year and change into father's diagnosis, his nightly calls began to become more frequent. My sister and I, his youngest children, spent countless hours in his room caring for him as his body gave up. Many nights we'd leave his room both knowing his condition was getting much worse, but we chose to say nothing of it.""

I can't stand to see you cry is an exploration of Texas and the surrounding states, as well as the people who are fixed within its complex landscape. Fortune analyses relationships between family, friends and strangers, all caught in a flood of health and environmental issues while working to maintain grace. The artist uses his own personal experiences to explore the friction between public and private life, and the unspoken tensions in daily life through an approach rooted in the landscape. Moreover, Fortune’s biographical approach to photography attempts to unpack his own identity and experience in the midst of a pandemic, civil unrest, a cross-country move, a career, and the loss of a parent, thinking about both the future and past.

Tamasha,Abhishek Khedekar,false,"The inaugural winner of the Publishing Performance residency and book award uses sculpture, collage and reappropriation to capture the synaesthesia of a rural Indian working-class spectacle.

Indian artist Abhishek Khedekar's experimental docu-fiction follows a 100-person nomadic troupe of Dalit 'families' performing Tamasha: a travelling form of performance combining dance, music, and visual art dating back to the 1800s. As post-independence India moved away from rural dance and song forms, Tamasha became stigmatised, polarised and relegated in Indian society. Criss-crossing the state of Maharashtra, Khedekar's images dive into the complexity of this sociocultural fabric with a dizzying array of artistic techniques by utilising archival material, collage, documentary photography, performance, sound and video.

Khedekar's bricolage of experimental visual narratives elevates the make-do, unpretentious attitude of Tamasha performance into a unique aesthetic of song, community and expression: situating Tamasha's traditions in modern India.

Khedekar is the recipient of Publishing Performance 2022 : an artist’s residency and publishing award focused on the intersections of photography and performance. Khedekar developed his work as artist-in-residence at Mahler & LeWitt Studios in Spoleto, Italy, for a book to be edited, designed and published by Loose Joints.

Shipping July 2023

Abhishek Rajaram Khedekar (b. 1991) is a photographer based in New Delhi, India. His work revolves around documenting stories bordering between reality and fiction, creating narratives, and curating archival images. Khedekar studied Masters in Photography Design at the National Institute of Design, India. He is currently working as a freelance photographer and designer, while also focusing on his long-term photo-based projects. Khedekar is the 2022 recipient of the Loose Joints/Mahler & Lewitt Studios Publishing Performance award .

Holy Island,Kingsley Ifill & Danny Fox,false,"An atmospheric collaboration between a photographer and a painter traces the outline of England to reveal its fraying edges.

Over the course of eight days in December 2021, Danny Fox and Kingsley Ifill travelled across the length of the British Isles and back again. Setting off from near Dover, Kent, and making their way up the east coast as far as the Isle of Skye, Scotland, to then return by way of the West Midlands, Wales and many others locations on route. With no predetermined course, their journey was one of intuition and self-led discovery, encountering and documenting the reality of the British landscape unfurling ahead of them.

Composed of a series of fifty collaborative works on paper which bring together photography by Ifill and paintings by Fox, Holy Island is a visual travelogue of their time spent together: an exploration into the cross-section of rural and urban fabric that makes up Britain today.

Kingsley Ifill (b.1988) lives and works between Kent, UK and Paris, France. Ifill’s tactile practice explores screenprinting, photocopying, darkroom printing and risograph – as well as a deep connection to printed matter through his independent publishing imprint Tarmac Press. Selected solo exhibitions include V1 Gallery, Copenhagen; LNCC, Golborne Gallery, Cob Gallery, London; and Gallery Pleasewait in Paris. Danny Fox (b. 1986) lives and works in Cornwall, UK. Profoundly influenced by native St Ives, Fox conjures wild and wonderful scenes of coastal Britain alongside expressive paintings exploring tragedy, promise, violence and sex. His work was recently exhibited at Alexander Berggruen, New York; Eighteen Gallery, Copenhagen; Berggruen Gallery, San Francisco and Zidoun-Bossuyt Gallery, Luxembourg City. Through intuition and self-discovery, their collaborative practice extends conversations between the mediums of painting and photography. Previous collective publications include Eye for a Sty, Tooth for the Roof and Haze , both published by Tarmac Press in 2020. Holy Island was exhibited at Hannah Barry Gallery in London in early 2022.

Broken Spectre,Richard Mosse,false,"Mosse pushes the boundaries of photography to raise an urgent warning cry over catastrophic destruction in the Amazon rainforest.

Devastation in the Amazon rainforest and the climate change it triggers tend to unfold in ways that are too vast to comprehend, too minute to perceive, and too normalised to see. In an attempt to render the scale and urgency of the Amazon’s extensive, impending collapse, Richard Mosse’s most ambitious work to date employs a dazzling array of photographic techniques. Broken Spectre is an immersive, 74-minute film that shifts between a manifold of ecological narratives, from the topographic to the anthropocentric, and to a careful examination of nonhuman violence and survival. Mosse and his team spent years documenting different fronts of destruction, degradation and environmental crimes in the Amazon Basin and related eco-systems. Broken Spectre operates on multiple scales: inky, fluorescent microscopic imagery describes the interdependent complexity of the Amazonian biome in scientific detail, while cinematic monochrome infrared scenes track illegal mining, logging and burning, industrial agriculture and indigenous activism.

Meanwhile, airborne multispectral footage starkly renders vast swathes of empty land in contrast to the lush rainforest, showing the vast scale and systematic organisation of the Amazon’s destruction. In accompanying photographic works, Mosse renders the invisible visible: through multispectral cameras that emulate satellite imaging technology, alongside ultraviolet botanical studies, and heat-sensitive analogue film warped, mottled and degraded by the oppressive environment and by the burning forest itself. Accompanying these experimental documentary works are Mosse's hypnotically vivid aerial maps, which zoom out and colourise the scale and extent of natural decimation in piercing detail, employing specially-made Geographic Information System (GIS) imaging technology. As climate change continues to define our era and the future of the planet, Mosse bears witness to a rapidly unfolding catastrophe: recent scientific studies predict that the Amazon is close to reaching a tipping point, at which stage it will no longer be able to generate rain, triggering mass forest dieback and carbon release at devastating levels, impacting climate change, biodiversity, and local and international communities. Mosse shows both human sides of the tragedy: from the Yanomami and Munduruku Indigenous communities fighting for survival; to illegal gold miners poisoning and destroying entire river systems for tiny handfuls of gold; alongside Brazilian cowboys wilfully burning their pristine surroundings to create pasture for cattle to sell on international meat and leather markets.

Created from 2018 to 2022, Broken Spectre was published ahead of the significant general elections in Brazil in which Jair Bolsanaro was stripped of the presidency. Bolsonaro and his executive decimated Brazil's environmental protection agencies and opened the floodgates of deforestation, exponentially accelerating the Amazon's destruction. Should Bolsanaro have been victorious in his 2022 campaign, the fate of the Amazon may have been sealed forever. Broken Spectre is currently exhibited at Jack Shainman Gallery , New York, 12 January – 16 March 2024; Musée de l'Elysée , Switzerland, 2 November 2023 – 28 January 2024; BOZAR , Brussels, 01 Dec 23 – 21 Jan 24; The Momentary , Bentonville, AK, 18 Nov 23 – 14 Apr 24.

Broken Spectre was previously exhibited at 180 Studios, London, 12 October – 26 February 2023 ; the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia, 30 September 2022 – October 2023 ; the Converge 45 Biennial , opening 24 August 2023 in Portland, Oregon; and Minnesota Street Project Foundation , 1201 Minnesota Street, 11 May - 30 June 2023.

Richard Mosse (b. 1980) is an Irish artist currently based in New York. Documenting some of the most significant humanitarian and environmental crises of our time, his work has been the subject of recent solo exhibitions at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, Barbican Art Gallery in London, and the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne. Recent survey exhibitions were held at Kunsthalle Bremen (2022) and MAST Foundation, Bologna (2021). Mosse was the recipient of the Prix Pictet 2017, the winner of the 2014 Deutsche Börse Photography Prize, and represented Ireland at the Venice Biennale with the six-screen video installation The Enclave in 2013. Previous publications by Mosse include The Castle (MACK, 2018), Incoming (MACK, 2017), and Infra (Aperture Foundation, 2012).

Like a River,Daniel Jack Lyons,false,"An anthropological exploration of identity, transformation and coming-of-age amongst marginalised communities in the heart of the Amazon.

Daniel Jack Lyons’ debut monograph continues the American artist’s long-term commitments to visualising the social and political rights of under-represented communities. Initially from a background of social and medical anthropology, Lyons began working in the Amazon under the umbrella of Casa do Rio, a community-based organisation that celebrates and supports the cultural lives of teenagers and young people living in the depths of the Amazon. Lyons particularly visualises and empowers the trans and queer communities of the region, exploring how deep indigenous traditions and modern identity politics meet in a celebratory, safe space, deep in the lush canopies and vegetation of the rainforest. Lyons’ empowering images celebrate the perennial coming-of-age impulses to express and affirm one’s individuality, resilient here in the Amazon against a toxic mix of environmental degradation, violence, and discrimination. As another generation passes through the quotidian rites and rituals of adolescence, Lyons asks: what sort of world will they inhabit, and how much autonomy will they have over it?

Daniel Jack Lyons (b. 1981) is an American artist and anthropologist whose work focuses largely on marginalized youth, whether occupying spaces on the periphery of society or in the face of conflict. He has exhibited work internationally, most recently in Los Angeles, New York, Milan, Amsterdam, Warsaw, London, and Mozambique. His work has appeared in numerous publications including the New York Times , i-D , the New Yorker , and Vogue Italia .

Harper's Bazaar (in Italian)

Photographs is a story of British artist Jack Davison’s experiments with image making from 2007 to present. Originally published in May 2019 , Davison’s debut monograph has now sold through two print runs. To celebrate the third printing of this book, Davison and Loose Joints invited thirty-two different artists to have a carte blanche at responding to Jack’s images.

For the Photographs Annotated Artists Edition , an international selection of artists were sent a physical copy of Davison’s original book and given free rein to scribble, annotate, rework, cut out, destroy and generally enjoy Jack’s malleable images. The result is a uniquely collaborative reworked version of Photographs , which within the same format, sequence and layout as the original creates a hybridised, playful and open-ended book, ranging from extravagant and visceral reworkings, where Davison’s original source images are near-obliterated, to schoolboy doodles and crayon scribbles by Davison’s young nieces and nephews.

Shoulder-to-shoulder are artists foremost in their mediums, such as Nathalie du Pasquier, Atelier Bingo, Ruth van Beek, Stefan Marx, Marie Jacotey and John Booth, alongside emerging, new and young voices in illustration, collage and contemporary drawing.",https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345309,https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots2_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345309|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots4_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots5_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots6_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots7_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots8_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots9_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots11_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots12_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots13_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots14_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots17_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots19_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots22_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots23_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots24_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots25_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots26_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots27_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots31_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots35_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots36_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots37_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots38_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots50_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots51_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots55_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots56_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots58_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots59_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots60_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots62_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots64_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots65_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots66_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots69_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots71_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots73_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots76_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots77_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots78_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots79_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots80_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots81_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots83_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345435|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots84_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345436|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/JD_annotated_shots3_1080x1080.jpg?v=1618345436,available,https://loosejoints.biz/collections/current-titles/products/photographs-annotated
The Model Family,Tealia Ellis Ritter,false,"Intergenerational love, loss, trauma and joy are explored in a project mining the ambiguities of memory, through thirty years of the artist photographing her family.

Ellis Ritter’s first monograph The Model Family loops and deconstructs family photographs of the past and her own contemporary images, in the process confronting head-on the ambiguity of photography and its role in memory and identity. However, far from being a space of nostalgia, The Model Family explores family dynamics with unflinching detail: death, birth, conflict, divorce and sexuality mix matter-of-factly alongside conventional, aspirational nuclear normality: pets, marriage , smiling faces, deep summer evenings. In Ellis Ritter’s circular conception of the family, imperceptibly oscillating between the past and the present, the artist explores how the images of those closest to you are also often the most slippery, sliding just out of reach.

Tealia Ellis Ritter (b. 1978) is an American artist, currently living and working in rural Connecticut. Her work has been exhibited internationally, most recently by Aperture, Taschen NYC, the Swab Art Fair, Barcelona and as part of Designing Women III: MOTHER .

Eli Durst - The Four Pillars,,false,"Durst scrutinises aspirational American fantasies of happiness, self-improvement and individuality in a provocative critique of social rituals, groups and norms.

The Four Pillars grew out of a relationship with a faith-based self-help group in Newtown, Connecticut, that Durst photographed over several years. Despite their ostensibly comfortable lives, these affluent suburbanites felt unfulfilled and directionless. They met weekly in church basements to discuss spiritual and secular strategies to find meaning and purpose, and to deconstruct the markers of success, progress and identity within middle-class American society.

Durst's staged, inventive images build organically on this self-critical base structure by inventing scenarios that interrogate the relationship between the individual and the group, the norms we aspire to, and the social gravity that holds these two in alignment. Durst takes the details of these scenarios – mundane family portraits, team bonding exercises, pregnancy groups, school gyms, amateur theatre, county fairs – and amplifies their strangeness, through a lens that is at once factual, fictional, banal and absurd.

Eli Durst (b. 1989) is an American artist whose work explores the social forces and group dynamics that shape the suburban American experience. Durst’s photographs have been exhibited internationally and have been featured in Aperture, The New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker, Vogue, and The Atlantic among others. His first monograph, The Community (Morel, 2020), received Special Mention for the Author’s Book Award at Les Rencontres d’Arles in 2020.

Prabérians,Thomas Rousset,false,"Rousset uses the agricultural working village of his childhood, on the border of France and Switzerland, to examine the totemic and ritualistic aspects of rural life.

Over twelve years, Thomas Rousset has probed every corner of his family village to create a surrealistic yet tender docu­fiction of its inhabitants. As small­-scale agricultural villages appear stuck in time or close to extinction, Rousset catapults Prabert into a fantastical, hallucina­tory world, creating heightened moments of absurdity amongst intimate portraits and observations of daily village life.

In his creative collaborations with his fellow Prabérians, Rousset engages with deep traditions of rural eccentricity and a dignified non-conformity that unites and binds communities against the harsh realities of everyday agricultural life. Rousset mixes these exaggerated scenarios with striking landscapes and naturalistic portraits, hinting at the creative potential locked within the land and its inhabitants, and the daily dance between work and play, solemnity and joy.

Thomas Rousset (b.1984) lives and works between Lausanne (CH) and Paris (FR). Using staging as a device playing on the edge of reality and fiction, his work examines the totemic and ritualistic aspects of everyday life. His work has been exhibited in Amsterdam, Bienne, Berne, Cologne, Zurich, Genève and Arles, and featured in magazines such as FOAM and Blink Magazine. Previous publications include 164° On the Equator in collaboration with Charles Negre (Études, 2015), and Waska Tatay in collaboration with Raphaël Verona (Idpure Éditions, 2014).

Mark McKnight - Heaven is a Prison,,false,"Loose Joints is proud to present Heaven is a Prison by Mark McKnight, an exploration of intimacy with and within the austere terrain of Southern California’s high desert.

In Heaven is a Prison , McKnight describes a queer otherworld that is at once utopic and purgatorial – occupied by a solitary pair of copulating, Sisyphean protagonists that appear both liberated and bound by their intimacies and the severe expanse in which they are depicted.

Divided into chapters, the poetic sequences in this book oscillate between the literal and the figurative, between distance and communion, and between violence and affection. Claustrophobic, horizonless landscapes are coupled with images of ethereal clouds and tangled bodies that are simultaneously sculptural, shrewd, and tender.

Through his synonymous description of landscape and body, McKnight suggests metaphor, pointing at both as vehicles – towards transcendence, bondage, beauty, and abjection – while also revealing them as two sides of the same coin.

Heaven is a Prison is the recipient of the 2020 Light Work Photobook Award , given annually to an artistic project that deserves international attention.

Mark McKnight is a Los Angeles-based artist who has exhibited and published work throughout the United States and in Europe. Recent solo exhibitions include Mark McKnight (Aperture Foundation, 2020) and in this temporarily prevailing landscape (Klaus von Nichtssagend, 2020). Mark is the recipient of the 2019 Aperture Portfolio Prize, the 2020 Light Work Photo Book Award, and a 2020 Rema Hort Mann Emerging Artist Grant. He is currently represented by Klaus von Nichtssagend, New York and Park View/Paul Soto, Los Angeles.

Hedda,Fin Serck-Hanssen,false,"Fin Serck-Hanssen (Oslo, 1958) started his career in the early 1980s, photo documenting the punk and underground music scene both in Norway and the UK. He captured the behind the scenes of legendary bands such as Depeche Mode, The Cure, R.E.M. and the Clash. Since the 1990s Serck- Hanssen has portrayed the Norwegian queer community during and after the AIDS crisis. Furthermore, he focused on projects of social justice, offering a platform of visibility to the living conditions of North Sea divers or inmates in national detention centres. His work has been exhibited internationally, including at Helsinki City Art Museum, Helsinki (FI), ICA, London (UK), Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Copenhagen (DK). His work is part of private and public collections including Victoria & Albert Museum, London (UK) and National Museum of Contemporary Art, Oslo (NO).

Over the last five years, Norwegian artist Fin Serck-Hanssen followed and documented the gender confirming journey of close friend Hedda, who from her early twenties travelled from Oslo to Buenos Aires and Bangkok to undergo cosmetic surgeries and a vaginoplasty.

Serck-Hanssen and Hedda’s images are made collaboratively to build a complex portrait of both physical and psychological changes within a young person’s life and show with unflinching honesty the realities of Hedda’s confirming, surgeries, and recovery. Hedda reflects on the construction of identity in the 21st century, mixing her selfies and curation of an online identity against Serck-Hanssen’s tender but direct portraiture of her most vulnerable moments. The book also bears traces of this identity being shaped: dark, almost imperceptible images, heavy with overprinted black ink, show the traces of photographs of that Hedda chose not to disclose of herself. Hedda finishes with an immersive short fictional story by novelist Genevieve Hudson, exploring ideas of ambiguity, transition and change.

Love Bites,Tim Richmond,false,"Richmond’s elegiac, sombre ode to a coastal stretch of the Bristol Channel poetically weaves together lives hit by decades of austerity and isolation.

Along this twenty-mile stretch of one of the world's longest coastal mudflats, Richmond’s Love Bites encounters those attempting to find meaning and pleasure within small-town England. Beneath everyday photographs of food banks, punks, pleasure arcades, swingers’ clubs, shelters and new-build houses, Richmond finds a waning unease to his subjects: a listless microcosm of post-austerity, post-Brexit Britain. Love Bites allows these tensions to simmer on the surface: food poverty, isolation, commercial decline, housing precarity, homelessness, unfulfilled desire and longing mingle in the overcast, wide skies of the channel and its flat, sprawling coastline.

Continuing in a long line of British photographers that weave poetry and lyricism into social documentary projects, Richmond uses a delicate colour palette and sympathetic lens to capture the everyday realities of isolation and desire in this corner of Southwest England.

Tim Richmond (b. 1959) is a British photographer based in Colorado specialising in long-term documentary projects. His first book, Last Best Hiding Place , was published in 2015, and his work is housed in many private collections and has been shown internationally. Richmond’s work has been featured in L’Uomo Vogue, Telegraph Magazine, Vanity Fair, World of Interiors, Wonderland, Port, and many others.

Falling,Gabby Laurent,false,"A fall from grace, falling asleep, falling pregnant, falling in-line or falling apart: falling is an act both comic and tragic, full of loss and wilful abandon, an act repeated throughout our lives. Reflecting on personal situations of bereavement and new life, Gabby Laurent’s performed choreography of falling is a space for self-reflection, allowing her body to repeatedly give way to gravity and create a visual space to contemplate time, fate and circumstance.

What is it to fall? The idiomatic vocabulary Laurent draws on suggests a failure of some kind, a lack of control and composure, which we are led to believe is unwomanly and unbecoming. Drawing on the visual language of feminist and performative art practices, Falling explores an abandoning of self-control and embracing of fate. However, dig deeper and we discover there is a contradictory element to Laurent’s images; for if falling is essentially accidental, then Laurent’s subversive and intentional performances capture a moment of control, rather than the loss of it.

There is a striking sequence of photographs featuring the artist precariously rising from a set of starting blocks whilst heavily pregnant. There are the ubiquitous slipping socks on the stairs, and the dramatic fall from a bicycle. Other, smaller moments capture Laurent’s body in pure free-fall, suspended within a photographic web of grain and blur, liberated from the landscape. Different moments and gestures are reversed, intermeshed, repeated or contradicted within the staccato, broken sequences of the book, inviting us to consider our relationship to the different daily experiences that wash over us and elicit reactions – a flickering, Muybridge-esque procession of emotions and states of mind. Each gesture elicits the same viewer response – the sharp draw of breath when we witness a stranger fall in the street. But more than simply comical acts of failure, Laurent’s work equally represents a gesture of defiance, as the artist inevitably picks herself up and dusts herself off.

People of the Mud,Luis Alberto Rodriguez,false,"People of the Mud is a powerful new series by Berlin-based US-Dominican artist Luis Alberto Rodriguez, made collaboratively amongst the communities of County Wexford in Ireland, where ancient tradition and modern life rub shoulders daily.

With a background in professional dance, Rodriguez’s work pays tribute to the metaphorical weight of centuries of physical labour behind cultivating the landscape and maintaining cultural heritage. Images of scarred limbs and hands, weathered faces and choreographed bodies appear as a cartography of this labour, reflecting how culture both shapes and is shaped by individuals. Elsewhere, we see the exaggerated glamour of modern female Irish dancers taken out of the glitzy ballrooms and into the fields, creating a rupture across time and space.

While in Wexford, Rodriguez was struck by the intense physicality of the sport of hurling. Considered to be the fastest sport on grass, while watching slow-motion footage of hurling Rodriguez saw that within seconds the players would go through pushing, shoving, grabbing, hugging, knocking each other down and then lifting one another up. Rodriguez worked with players to reform these gestures: creating sculptures out of bodies, directing and literally layering players upon one another.

At the outset of his project, Rodriguez wanted to create a large family photograph, an idea that was quickly surpassed by other strands of enquiry. However, with a step backwards we can see People of the Mud as just that – a collective community portrait of all the different elements that construct modern, rural Irish identities. Just like any family portrait, it is at times dysfunctional and contradictory; it gathers all the ruptures and continuities between the past and present in modern Ireland, while being held in a landscape and moment in time. This moment is both still – posed and paused – and in perpetual motion, looking towards the future.

Material,Jet Swan,false,"A striking new photographic voice engages with street portraiture to create dark, interior psychological spaces exploring the relationship between public and private lives.

British artist Jet Swan’s first monograph collects together the last three years of the artist's engagement with members of the public through impromptu studio spaces, such as an empty shopfront inside a commercial mall in Scarborough, northeast England, and a repurposed community hall in Ramsgate, Kent, where the artist lives and works.

Swan balances the public identities nurtured and maintained by those who pass through her studio against darker, intimate photographic spaces, contrasting private and tactile images of the body with photographs that skirt around the margins of conventional staged portraiture. With a new text in response by acclaimed poet Rachael Allen.

Jet Swan (b.1990) grew up in North Yorkshire. Her work moves between the parameters of documentary and classical portraiture. She lives and works in Ramsgate, Kent.

Nearest Truth #188: Brad Feuerhelm in conversation with Miranda Lichtenstein

Press: British Journal of Photography

Loose Joints is proud to present Recorder , an immersive new book of works by American photographic artist Miranda Lichtenstein. For nearly two decades, Lichtenstein has worked in varied subgenres within photography’s historical archetypes: marginalized contemporary landscapes, refracted still life, performance-based portraiture and process-oriented abstraction. In Recorder , Lichtenstein embarks on an ambitious three-part series of images that recycle and reorient themselves within the limits of technology and photographic vision.

Every image in Lichtenstein’s layered artist book departs from a singular work: Welcome Water , where Lichtenstein collaborated with J. Stoner Blackwell to make flatbed scans of the artist’s delicate sculptures derived from disposable carrier bags, which were then cut out and stitched into a sprawling sculptural floorpiece. Meditating on the waste and burdensome environmental significance of these single-use plastic objects, Lichtenstein accumulated and activated the detritus of Welcome Water , using the negative cutouts and test-prints of the work to recycle them into new photographic forms.

The results are three series that are both distinct and inseparably intertwined: Holes , a series of black-and-white images reworking Blackwell’s delicate laser-cut interventions to the carrier bags; Grounds , a physical layering of leftover cutout shapes, pinned and affixed, leaving a gaping void at the photographic centre; and finally, Untitled , Lichtenstein’s boldest foray into abstraction, where her source materials were repeatedly printed and scanned, sometimes up to thirty times, to create a giddying and vertiginous collaboration with the entropy of print technology. These works are layered with ink, program errors, exaggerations and obfuscations, eventually liberating her source material into pure free-form visual abstraction.

Lichtenstein creates images that are at once challenging and seductive, setting forth a chain reaction of feedback loops in which pictorial space is filled and mutated through collaboration with and against the limits of imaging technologies. Recorder contains profound depths and coalescent shapes that never fully resolve themselves, but within this profundity a clear thread can be drawn, connecting the push-and-pull of photography’s tendency to both record and obscure, with a meditation on waste, consumption, and the environmental changes set loose by the anthropocene.",https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006831,https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots2_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006831|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots34_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006971|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots3_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006971|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots5_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006971|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots6_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006971|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots9_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006971|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots10_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006971|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots11_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006971|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots18_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006971|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots19_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006971|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots17_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006971|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots12_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006971|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots13_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006971|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots14_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006971|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots21_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006971|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots22_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006971|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots24_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616007171|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots23_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616007171|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots25_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616007171|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots27_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616007171|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots29_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616007171|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots30_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616007171|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots31_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616007171|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots4_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616007171|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots33_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616007171|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/Miranda-shots32_1080x1080.jpg?v=1616006971,available,https://loosejoints.biz/collections/current-titles/products/miranda-lichtenstein
Apiary,Robin Friend,false,"Friend's second book Apiary continues to explore the surreal and sinister haunting of the British landscape with an apocalyptic, nocturnal series flirting with notions of democracy and resistance.

Apiary uses a cinematic lens to uncover the dark underbelly of Lewes, a town in South East England renowned for its wild, bacchanalian, festivities around Guy Fawkes’ Night, the uniquely British festivity celebrating the failure of an attempted act of extreme political terrorism. However, Friend’s images are a far cry from an exercise in folklore; tight cropping, intensified details and a push-and-pull between the crowd and individual recall images of riots and political insurrections. Apiary is a shadow space, reflecting a contemporary moment where ideas of democracy, identity and cohesion feel stretched to breaking point. Friend uses the night as a metaphor to consider the rippling reflections of unrest, inequality and instability lapping the British Isles.

Signed books ships from France only.

Robin Friend (b.1983) is a London-based photographer who grew up in Melbourne, Australia. He divides his time between his fine art practice and commissioned work. His first book, Bastard Countryside , was published by Loose Joints in 2018 to critical acclaim. Recent projects include the award-winning books Sanctuary: Britain’s Artists and their Studios and Art Studio America (Thames & Hudson, 2011-13); a collaborative choreographic work for the BBC, Winged Bull in the Elephant Case (2017, with Wayne McGregor); and a National Gallery exhibition project, documenting the gallery's wartime art storage in a Snowdonian mine (2018). Friend's work has been exhibited at Aperture Gallery, New York; Christie's, Paris and at the National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Somerset House & the Royal Academy of Arts in London.

Bharat Sikka - Where the flowers still grow,,false,"120 pages, 45 colour & 16 duotone plates, 220 x 260 mm
Trimmed hardcover with frayed linen edges and tip-on
ISBN 978-0-9934303-7-4
September 2017

The state of Kashmir holds a mythic place in the mind of India. Long known as one of the world’s most beautiful mountain valleys, since the late 1980s it has become synonymous with a political and sectarian conflict which strikes at the very heart of India’s identity. Delhi-based Sikka travelled throughout Kashmir in 2014 and 2015, to attempt to make some sense of this troubled region through his own personal experience. Taking inspiration from Mirza Waheed’s novel The Collaborator , which tells the story of a young Kashmiri man’s struggle with his own sense of self buffeted by the exigencies of history and the present, the resulting project is a meditation on the rich, green landscape and those who have lived and struggled within it.

The central core of Where the flowers still grow is comprised of portraits of young men, shot alone within the colossal grandeur of an unspoiled landscape that seems to know nothing of national borders and political rivalries. The men stare at Sikka’s camera, which stares back at them, as if their silent images hold within them millions of words needed to explain everything. Having fused portraits of Kashmiri men with their landscapes, Sikka set out to record the more personal details of his visits, photographing objects found in homes but also animals, abandoned buildings, and elements of nature. These details provide a mise-en-scene for Sikka’s project, articulating a more nuanced interpretation of the region and its inhabitants, as well as highlighting the endless contrasts between the bucolic, indifferent natural world and human and individual lives and dreams. What we are ultimately left with is Sikka’s emotional response to his visits to Kashmir, the residual evidence of traumatic events, and the mute witnesses to the convulsions of history.

Bharat Sikka (1973, New Delhi) studied at Parsons School of Design, and lives between Europe and India. Documenting contemporary visions of India, recent exhibitions include Reimagine for Photoworks/Brighton Photo Biennial 2016, and Where the flowers still grow at the Kochi-Muziris Biennale 2016 and Nature Morte in 2017. His work has been exhibited at the National Museum in New Delhi; Project 88 and Chatterjee & Lal in Mumbai; Fotomuseum Winterthur, Switzerland; Whitechapel Gallery, London; ICP, New York; Unseen, Amsterdam; and the Arles Photo Festival. His book Matter was shortlisted for the 2017 First Book Award. He is represented by Nature Morte in India.

Xiaopeng Yuan - Campaign Child,,false,"48 pages, 25 colour photos, 213 × 275 mm

Campaign Child by Chinese artist Xiaopeng Yuan uses the backdrop of commercial photoshoots to create new, unexpected narratives through the manipulation of bodies and objects in space. While developing as an artist, Yuan found himself routinely commissioned by Chinese kidswear brands to photograph white Western models and American settings within his native Shanghai. Using this controlled context as a parameter, Yuan began to excavate surreal, incongruous images with his young collaborators.

Campaign Child indulges in the language of commercial photography to create new meanings out of disparate objects, bodies and situations. Each image attempts a balance: between the pure, clean, functional axis of photography as a communication tool, and the slippages that occur when juxtaposition and narrative gaps leave space for the mind to unfold. Yuan’s images often feel as if you have stumbled into a story in medias res : a young girl emerging from a tablecloth, an escaped budgie being trapped, a hospital bed dripping with liquid. Through unlikely combinations, Yuan asks us to consider what is existing outside the frame and forge links across disparate scenes, where each photograph bounces off the other to create uncanny new contexts. By restructuring commercial photoshoots into a space of imagination and play, Campaign Child also speaks of the uneasy relationship between Western capitalist motifs and the global contexts they insert themselves into while questioning how desire is validated through photography.

Sean Vegezzi - DMYCC,,false,"624 pages, 723 colour plates, 205 × 290 mm
Cold glue perfect-bound softback with a faux-leather cover
ISBN 978-0-9934303-8-1
Published in September 2017

DMYCC by Sean Vegezzi documents the artists’ decade-long engagement with a cavernous underground area constructed beneath Lower Manhattan. It is one of several tunnel segments built in the 1970s by the New York City Transit Authority for the Second Avenue Subway, a convoluted and controversial subway line that was proposed as early as 1919, and partially realized in 2017. After the initial construction of the tunnel segment, the space was quickly overlooked, and prior to its discovery by Vegezzi, the phantom-like provisional enclosure lay in a state of non-use and deterioration. DMYCC is an initialism that encompasses the physical space itself, the desire to gain access to it, and a shifting roster of efforts to install and enact a private recreational domain within it.

As their surrounding city experienced aggressive development and a hyper-securitization of public and private realms, Vegezzi and his friends were drawn towards undefined spaces to pursue their own forms of autonomy and release. From early adolescence onward, they leveraged this piece of failed architecture into an alternate social forum, stage, club, and studio space. After a large party left the space in complete disrepair, Vegezzi planned a large-scale renovation, culminating in an exhibition of photographic works within the space. As intense preparation for the exhibition was unexpectedly discovered and halted, security measures increased and the group's engagement with the space took on the current contours of the project.

Presented in book form as a loose chronological narrative, the images in DMYCC eventually form a comprehensive mapping of the territory; ranging from early evocative analogue photographs of youthful explorations through to video stills, receipts, and architectural floor plans; concluding with full-scale photographic surveys that challenge bureaucratic structural reports in both detail and formal composition. Elsewhere, Vegezzi turns the methodologies of surveillance back onto the authorities and other intruders, monitoring their communications, mapping their moves, vehicles, their trash and their notes. Vegezzi’s desire for indexicality grows over time in extent and fastidiousness; as if the accumulation of images validates his acts of ownership without title. We see DMYCC develop from a contaminated space with non-functioning utilities into one treated with dust control chemicals to improve air quality, a working drainage system, primed walls, repaired electricity lines and meticulously considered lighting systems.

Through the quiet, disciplined nature of their renovation work, Vegezzi and his friends deconstruct the distinctions between sanctioned municipal overhauls and more informal ones. Vegezzi takes these gestures to their logical extremes, in which physical boundaries and barriers are strategically undone and each task forensically documented. These documents are sympathetic yet critical, positing the city as an unknowing collaborator.

Sean Vegezzi (b. 1990) is an artist whose work is comprised of image-making, sculpture, writing and spatial intervention. His practice examines the effect that both public and private space have on the individual, blending personal experience with narratives of autonomy, privacy and security. Vegezzi’s first book of photographs, IDWGU (Fourteen-Nineteen, 2012) is a narrative of adolescence in Lower Manhattan. Vegezzi’s recent work includes large-scale exhibitions such as Snow Cab (Loose Joints, 2016), and performative interventions such as Scott and Joey (both 2015) - as well as curatorial projects 15 Warren and 170 Suffolk .

Snow Cab catalogues an eponymous installation of works by Sean Vegezzi made between 15 and 22 November 2016. Installed within a vacated retail unit in Lower Manhattan, the works of Snow Cab actively blend and respond to the inert postconsumer space they inhabit, a space in which subsequent to their exhibition the works were left, in situ.

Vegezzi’s practice explores the blending of the individual with narratives of privacy, security and visibility within the American military-industrial complex. A departure from prior works, Snow Cab evolved as an immediate, frenzied and searching response following the Paris terror attacks of November 2015. Moving through the documentation of the exhibition we find t-shirts, sweeping compound, statues, core samples, Cold War rations, wildlife and more, repurposed and reappropriated for display amongst images and texts.

In the two accompanying texts to the exhibition, one of which was distributed to all exhibition visitors as a printed booklet, we find an interweaving of Vegezzi’s ongoing research into the security industry with personal experiences of love and terror. Many of the works we see are a series of gestures that both intervene in and undermine Vegezzi’s immediate environment of Manhattan. In one work, a black plexiglass panel has been cracked along its top edge, voiding its former purpose of stopping any light from entering the retail space. It balances delicately with a pixelated image of a blue sky, taken from the empty training headquarters of a prominent insurance company. Elsewhere, the vibrant red of an industrial sweeping compound used to eliminate dust sits within household plant pots.

These materials, used to control the flows of nature on an elementary level are reconfigured - modifying or corrupting the synthetic materiality of urban space and resembling the aftermath of some unforeseen event. As a piece of work that directly responds to the Paris Attacks, Snow Cab also traces and attempts to emulate material production as sympathetic evidence of experience in the wake of an event. This is evident in objects presented throughout the show and detailed in Vegezzi’s texts, but is most apparent in a collection of t-shirts that were hung up for display - depicting vilified terrorists, the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, a Pray for Paris slogan and hand-made shirts referencing waterboarding. In the re-framing of these items of clothing, Vegezzi highlights the notion of merchandise and profit from geopolitical terror, while also delicately articulating the human and vulnerable within our reactions and experiences of a modern, managed world.

White Ashes Fell presents photographs made by Stuart Whipps in Xilitla, Mexico in 2012. These photographs depict the surrealist sculpture garden of Las Pozas, a collection of 36 large concrete structures with titles such as The House with Three Stories That Could Be Five , and The Temple of The Ducks . Las Pozas was built by the English patron and poet Edward James between 1962 and 1979. These images are accompanied by photographs of the wooden moulds that were used to cast James' structures. The title comes from a story told to George Melly and published in ’Swans Reflecting Elephants':

The building occurred only after the first 20 years here. For the first 20 years I was only interested in horticulture and then suddenly, in 62 there was a snowfall. Nobody had seen snow before, they didn’t know what it was. When I got back from New York a month later they said Don Edwardo, for 3 days white ashes fell and burnt everything so then I decided I would do something that couldn’t be killed by freak weather so I began building only then, things that look like trees and plants and flowers. Things that could not be killed by snow.

The making of these photographs was generously supported by Wysing Arts Centre.",https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/209048-027673d68ba24e19aeb3e26c2d9a0c68_1080x1080.jpg?v=1576609666,https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/209048-fc403b7f421e40958f09b77ed4dc64a4_1080x1080.jpg?v=1576609666|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/209048-5450b4ee150647d4845fa47e77e5997f_1080x1080.jpg?v=1576609666|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/209048-cd25f926b1a342f58688cbfb659a18cd_1080x1080.jpg?v=1576609666|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/209048-b6481e347df84ff1a965c431b3ebc96e_1080x1080.jpg?v=1576609666|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/209048-6f6b3ecb226f40369c9e90065df3042e_1080x1080.jpg?v=1576609666|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/209048-659b03567c19475aa593c5cb52cad6de_1080x1080.jpg?v=1576609666|https://loosejoints.biz/cdn/shop/products/209048-1829c49787184ce598dc832c2d41ad3b_1080x1080.jpg?v=1576609666,available,https://loosejoints.biz/collections/current-titles/products/white-ashes-fell

Feeling with fingers that see by Stuart Whipps is the first in a series of books derived from the artists’ wide-ranging body of research into the human impulse to categorise, control and understand the world. The book’s origins are in an ongoing artwork by Whipps, A System for Communicating With The Ghost of Sir Christopher Wren , in which the artist explores an early iteration of sign language, pioneered in the seventeenth century by the architect and polymath Sir Christopher Wren. Whipps uses the system within photographs, installation, video and performance to both communicate with Wren from beyond the grave, and to disseminate pertinent messages discovered during his research.

Stuart Whipps is an artist based in Birmingham, UK. He often makes work about things he doesn’t understand and doesn't know how to do. Currently this includes restoring a 1979 Mini with the assistance of former British Leyland workers, training to make geological thin sections at the University of Birmingham and working with a seventeenth-century sign language devised by Sir Christopher Wren.

Giles Price - Restricted Residence,,false,"80pp, 197 × 300 mm, 42 photos printed with a custom experimental 5-colour profile
Sewn booklet with embossed buckram cover
with an essay by Fred Pearce in English & Japanese
ISBN 978-1-912719-13-6
January 2020

Restricted Residence by Giles Price examines the relocation of Japanese citizens to Namie and Iitate, two towns exposed to extreme radioactivity following the catastrophic leak at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

Despite the inconclusive scientific consensus of the long-term effects of radiation in the area, in 2017 the Japanese government began to reduce the exclusion zones and heavily financially incentivise residents to return to what were formerly bustling towns, with nearly 20,000 living and working there. Now, the area is eerily empty, with just a few hundred people brave enough to return. With the reactor still unrepaired and uninhabitable radiation hotspots scattered across the landscape, some believe these areas will not be safe for 50 years or longer.

Price’s images show ordinary, hard-working people hoping for a better future: clean-up and reconstruction workers, medical officers, office workers, a taxi driver who is paid a retainer to stay because there are so few customers, a mechanic, a farmer with contaminated cattle, which he can’t sell, but refuses to put down.

Restricted Residence employs thermal technology often used in medicine and surveying, to render the everyday landscapes of Namie and Iitate surreal and inverted. With an accompanying essay by environmental writer Fred Pearce, Restricted Residence attempts to illustrate the hidden stresses on those affected by the nuclear disaster, while raising questions about the broader impact of manmade catastrophes upon our fragile environment.

Georg Gatsas - Signal The Future,,false,"Photographer Georg Gatsas’ Signal The Future unpacks many layers of an important musical era in London. Through portraits, candid shots of clubbers, and architectural investigations of the city, a narrative unfolds of how music both shapes and is shaped by its immediate urban environment. Dating from 2008 – shortly after the British club phenomenon of dubstep received international acclaim – we’re introduced to a music scene in the flush of fame. Ethnically diverse, largely working-class, surprisingly close-knit, and a world apart from the country’s acclaimed indie and guitar rock history, the people in this book are united by the city and their love of the music. We glimpse dancers mid-stride, witness their steppers’ communion, and get a sense of their after-hours lives on the empty streets of Brixton in the night.

In a few short years, the tone of electronic music changed and so did the images – becoming brighter, taking place more often outside, and interspersed with the kind of soaring structures that are the hallmark of modernism. The book includes essays by acclaimed writers on music and cultural theory, including the late Mark Fisher, probing deeply into many of the strands that Gatsas visualises: urbanism, community, the ‘underground’, capitalism, networked futurism, gentrification, and more. Anyone not following underground music may be surprised to realise how much is contained within its scope. Gatsas helps bring those complexities alive.

Georg Gatsas is an artist, photographer and freelance journalist based in Zurich, Switzerland. Gatsas uses an interdisciplinary approach to focus on how sound, recollection, and public spaces interact. Recent solo and group exhibitions include Kunstmuseum St.Gallen (2017), Oldenburger Kunstverein (2017), Le Confort Moderne Poitiers (2017), FRAC Nord-Pas de Calais (2015), Museum Bärengasse Zurich (2013), and Kunstraum Riehen (2013). His editorial work has featured in a variety of magazines such as Interview, i-D, Dazed, Beat, Zweikommasieben and Edge.
