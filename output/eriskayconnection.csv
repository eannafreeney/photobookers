Fourteen Leaves and a Cup of Water,Michelle Piergoelam,true,"In Fourteen Leaves and a Cup of Water, Michelle Piergoelam (NL) explores the botanical knowledge of enslaved communities in Suriname. This knowledge formed an important source of strength and resistance. Enslaved people recognised plants in the Surinamese flora that were related to species from Africa and understood which leaves had medicinal properties and which plants were edible or poisonous. They also knew how these plants could be used to survive their situation – even to poison their oppressors. This deep-rooted expertise enabled them to endure harsh conditions, escape, survive, and establish free communities in the dense rainforests of Suriname.For this project, Piergoelam travelled to Suriname, her parents’ country of birth, for the first time in 2024. During her journey through the rainforest, she photographed plants first described in 1755 by the Swedish biologist Daniel Rolander. As a European observer, Rolander documented the use of plants in Suriname and recorded exchanges of knowledge between enslaved people and local communities. His accounts of resistance, from everyday acts to courageous escape attempts, and his observation that enslaved people knew the forest ‘like the back of their hand’ became an important source of inspiration for Piergoelam. Through collaboration with biologists from Naturalis and local partners in Suriname, including Irvin Ristie, who guided Piergoelam through the rainforest, and shaman Amashina Oedemmaloe, the project intricately connects art, shamanism, and science.Many traditional customs in Suriname have remained largely unchanged. Cups are still carved from the white wood of the kwasibita tree and filled with water or alcohol; the bitter drink is used to combat malaria fever. The highly poisonous drunguman (drunkard), named after the staggering gait that results from drinking the herb, is no longer used to poison Europeans, but lives on in herbal baths intended to ward off supernatural enemies. Suriname, a multicultural society with exceptional biodiversity, has thousands of local plant names, not all of which have been documented. Nearly 270 years after Rolander, the Surinamese rainforest continues to hold new stories waiting to be heard and made visible.Within this broader practice, Fourteen Leaves and a Cup of Water forms the third chapter of Piergoelam’s ongoing project The Untangled Tales (2020–present), in which she explores sources of hope and strength among enslaved people in Suriname. Her work centres on underrepresented histories, oral traditions, and the resilience of cultural memory. She focuses on stories preserved through unwritten means, such as folklore, rituals, secret languages, songs, clothing, and plants, with a particular emphasis on Surinamese heritage and the legacy of transatlantic slavery.Fourteen Leaves and a Cup of Water is co-published with Naturalis Biodiversity Center.",https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/TEC150-300x200.webp,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/TEC150_01-1.webp,available,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/fourteen-leaves-and-a-cup-of-water/
Only Barely Still – On Women and Wilderness,Catherine Lemblé,true,"Only Barely Still – On Women and Wilderness is a long-term analogue photography project by Catherine Lemblé (BE) that reimagines the Arctic, and in particular the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, through the lives of the women who inhabit it. Inspired by Sarah, a former polar bear guard and now expedition leader, Lemblé set out to counter dominant Western narratives that have long framed the polar regions as a masculine frontier.While much of the Arctic is home to Indigenous peoples, Svalbard has no Indigenous population and has often been cast by outsiders as a remote, rugged outpost where only the toughest men survive. In the historical record shaped by early exploration, women are largely absent, appearing only as rare exceptions or companions. At the same time, Western imagination has repeatedly feminised the polar landscape as “virgin” and “barren” – a passive body to be conquered, tamed, or protected.Only Barely Still works in the space between these enduring misconceptions, about women and about the Arctic, and offers a quiet counter-narrative that centres female presence and perspective. Printed on thin, translucent paper, the one-sided spreads leave facing pages blank – yet faint outlines of nearby images shimmer through, creating a quiet space for the reader. Alongside Lemblé’s photographic narrative is a chapter of historical images of women on Svalbard from the archives of the Norwegian Polar Institute, bringing forward a glimpse into the visual history of female presence.The book also features an essay by Abi Andrews, who traces a lineage of women in Svalbard – from early hunters’ companions to contemporary residents – reframing their roles not as footnotes but as central actors in Arctic life. Weaving together overlooked histories, ecofeminist thought, and the counter-myths of authors such as Ursula K. Le Guin, Andrews asks what the polar story looks like when stripped of its “Heroic Age” trappings. When heroism is not conquest, but endurance, relation, and the quiet choice to leave no flag behind.",https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TEC148-300x200.webp,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TEC148_01-scaled.jpg,available,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/only-barely-still/
The Course of Water – Fieldnotes from California's Owens Valley,Todd Stewart,true,"The Course of Water – Fieldnotes from California’s Owens Valley explores the environmental and social histories of California’s Owens Valley by attending to the implications of its peculiar hydrology. A stolen river, a dry lake kept wet, Sierra snowmelt, turquoise springs: water takes strange paths in this desert landscape, rerouted by the lives of the people – Indigenous, settler, internee – who have called it home.At the turn of the twentieth century, a lack of water resources threatened to stall the growth of Los Angeles. The city began diverting water from the Owens River – over 200 miles away – culminating in the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913. This led to the eventual desiccation of Owens Lake and much of the surrounding valley. To date, Los Angeles has spent billions of dollars mitigating carcinogenic dust by transforming the dry lakebed into a wetland.To represent the allusive richness of natural and human flows in the Owens Valley, Todd Stewart (US) pairs his photographs of the region with select archival images, creating a complex visual map that the writing and notes of Robert Bailey (US) further deepen. What emerges is an occasion for viewers and readers to navigate thematic currents that intersect like the natural and artificial channels of this singular watershed.Stewart’s photographs depict this human-made landscape and its sustaining infrastructure as a dizzying knot of connected waterways. Other images touch on the contested meaning of water in the valley: a stark presentation of an Eastern Mono water basket; orchards planted by Japanese people interned during World War II. In the background, the region becomes a stage – movie stars shooting in the nearby Alabama Hills and Édouard Manet depicting their namesake, the Confederate ship Alabama, sinking during the United States’ first Civil War.The Course of Water offers evidence of how greed and hubris affect the planet and people, trapping the essence of life within controlled channels. Here, a looping water cycle appears: precipitation runs down from Mount Whitney, disappears below ground, reemerges a thousand years later in a hot spring, forms the Owens River, and disappears into pipes that help make Los Angeles possible. Archival images nuance this story, from the settler enablers of the valley’s transformation to the paths of Indigenous irrigation ditches. Drawing on these materials, Bailey shows how colonial patterns persist in current remediation efforts, even as Indigenous gardening resists in an austere climate made harsher with every sip the metropolis takes. If water is life, then The Course of Water shows what happens when life is deferred.",https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TEC147-300x200.webp,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TEC147_1-scaled.jpg,available,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/the-course-of-water/
The Buzzer,Miguel Proença,true,"The Buzzer is a long-term photographic project developed by Miguel Proença (PT) investigating shifting identities and geopolitical tensions in the post-Soviet space, with a focus on the Baltic states and their complex relationship with Russia. Set primarily in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, it examines how historical antagonisms between Russia and the West continue to play out in these former Soviet territories, now members of the EU and NATO.Combining photography, archival imagery, and extensive research, Proença traces the transformation of these landscapes and societies under competing cultural and political influences. It documents military exercises, national celebrations, and everyday encounters across the region, while also delving into the parallel worlds of conspiracy theories, Russian propaganda, and echo chambers affecting public perception. A key aspect of the project is the integration of archival materials, sourced mainly from the Estonian National Archives, which reinforces the visual and historical ambiguities of the narrative. Images of statues raised and toppled, borders drawn and erased, sit alongside contemporary scenes, inviting reflection on the legitimacy of competing historical narratives and the construction of national identity. Woven through the sequence is a selection of transcripts from UVB-76 – a mysterious shortwave radio signal believed to be of Russian military origin – which functions as an unsettling refrain, a reminder of a continuous, ghostly interference.The title, The Buzzer, draws from this same signal, symbolic of the lingering presence of a former empire and unresolved tensions. The project situates the Baltic region as a geopolitical buffer zone, both historically and today. With references ranging from the medieval Battle on the Ice to present-day NATO operations, it explores how spaces, myths, and power are contested and reshaped. Rather than offering a segmented or didactic narrative, Proença layers past and present, fiction and fact, nostalgia and fear – reflecting on the fragile, evolving nature of identity in a landscape marked by surveillance, occupation, and resilience.A separate vinyl release accompanies the project, featuring soundscapes by Pedro Augusto (PT) composed from original UVB-76 recordings.",https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TEC145-300x200.webp,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TEC145_01-scaled.jpg,available,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/the-buzzer/

"Floating Signifiers – Case studies on image, origin and representation",Daan Paans,true,"Panta Rhei is an old philosophical saying by Heraclitus that can be interpreted as “all that is observable flows continuously.” In the spirit of this reflection, Daan Paans (NL) attempts with Floating Signifiers to provide insight into the constant transformation that things and phenomena undergo under the influence of a complex set of factors. In a broader sense, he investigates how changeability is expressed in the visual culture of the past, present, and future.Over the past ten years, Paans has analysed the genesis of a wide range of subjects that come together in this publication. This has resulted in case studies ranging from the extinct aurochs to the pre-human paradise, the future life of an oak tree, meteorites from sci-fi films, variations of the lion man, and the Golden Idol of Indiana Jones.These case studies show how primal archetypes continue to shape our contemporary (visual) culture in their ‘transmuted’ forms. With the ambiguous nature of his work, Paans aims to point to our deeply cherished bond with ‘ecology’, but also to offer the insight that this ecology is subject to an evolutionary process of transformation.Paans’ research methodology relies heavily on the photographic medium, but in its development he usually expresses himself in the form of multimedia installations in which he uses video, 3D renderings, sculptures and documentary archive material – depending on the nature and meaning of his choice of subject.Floating Signifiers is a rich, comprehensive book, in which Paans has translated his philosophical reflections on the imaginary nature of time and space into a meaningful form. In the complementary essay, Nicky Heijmen investigates how the original meanings of cultural objects can change and what the impact of this is on a broader social level.",https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TEC136-300x200.webp,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TEC136_01-1.webp,available,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/floating-signifiers/
The Sierra,Aaron Rothman,true,"The Sierra revisits the Sierra Nevada mountains through the context of today’s climate crisis, a landscape that has long shaped American ideas of wilderness. Combining large-format film with digital post-production, Aaron Rothman (US) created this body of around fifty colour images over six years. The work seeks to evoke the physical experience of being in the mountains while registering the environmental changes reshaping the region, and places itself in dialogue with the long history of landscape representation.The Sierra Nevada holds personal significance for Rothman, inspiring a lifelong connection to nature and leading him to take up photography as a teenager. However, his recent visits have been marked by a growing sense of dread and loss as signs of climate change, such as forest fires and haze, become increasingly visible. This evolving relationship informs the project’s core aim: to capture the contradictions of being in a changing landscape, where personal attachment meets environmental uncertainty.Rothman works in an iterative process split between fieldwork and digital editing. In the field, he makes large-format photographs in response to meaningful natural encounters, such as the immeasurable sense of space evinced by a distant mountain peak, the sheltering confines of a copse of trees at dusk, or the devastation of a recently charred section of forest. In the studio, he determines their final form. Some images remain as they were, others are transformed by inverting colours, layering multiple views of a single place, or washing out an image to the edge of visibility. These interventions aim to unsettle the viewer, creating imagery that feels both familiar and strange.The European landscape tradition – from Jacob van Ruisdael and Théodore Rousseau to Albert Bierstadt – serves as a reference point, prompting reflection on how traditional representations have shaped our perception of wilderness, and how idealising it as pristine may have contributed to its present vulnerability.Ultimately, The Sierra challenges the icon it depicts: a landscape both majestic and fragile. It invites us to reimagine environmental realities and our relation to nature – not as something separate or untouched, but as an evolving space intertwined with human impact. And to confront that duality through images that are at once beautiful and unsettling.Including an accompanying text by renowned art critic and writer Leah Ollman.",https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TEC144-300x200.webp,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TEC144_01-scaled.jpg,available,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/the-sierra/
Atlantis,Oriane Thomasson,true,"Atlantis is an eclectic collection of photographs taken by Oriane Thomasson (FR) across various landscapes, interwoven with archival images. Through these visual correspondences, she constructs a photographic fiction of the legend of Atlantis.The myth of Atlantis, as recounted by Plato in Timaeus and Critias, describes a magnificent, vast, and prosperous island blessed with fertile land and abundant natural resources. Its inhabitants, descendants of Poseidon, lived in a society organised in harmony with nature. Over time, their ambition drove them to expand their empire and exploit new resources, provoking the wrath of Zeus. As punishment, he unleashed a devastating cataclysm that submerged the island beneath the waves. To this day, the myth continues to inspire archaeological theories and countless fictional narratives, and proves to be just as relevant today.Through this free reinterpretation, Thomasson creates her own narrative, composed of a photographic series and an original science fiction short story titled ‘The Meteors’. Together they trace a before-and-after, the allure of a ‘lost paradise’ and the marks of its collapse, revealing how evidence and invention together shape the writing of history. The work bridges what is known and what is imagined – what remains and what is missing – and treats archaeology and history not as neutral repositories but as story-making practices whose documents become material for the book’s fiction.Atlantis, just like Thomasson’s previous book Paradis, opens up a space for the imagination, where, from the shadow of submersion, new forms emerge. The series is built on cycles of disappearance and resurgence. Between the mysterious, unsettling world of the depths where Atlantis now belongs, and the enchanting images of this paradise of abundance. The book is printed on four different types of paper, each corresponding to a specific category of image: a warm-toned paper for images evoking the island of Atlantis and its classical Greek landscape; a thin, translucent paper referencing disappearance and oblivion, used for traces of a lost Atlantean culture; a bright white paper for images that convey a state of transition, from sinking landscapes to a man with a fish head; and a coated paper printed full-bleed for underwater imagery, to emphasise the submersion of the once-prosperous city.",https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TEC143-300x200.webp,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TEC143_01-scaled.jpg,available,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/atlantis/
The Infinite Tree (De Eindeloze Boom),Ron Dirven,true,"For more than 16 years on his free Mondays, Ron Dirven (NL) studied twigs, roots, trunks, blossoms, leaves, more trunks, and trees. Endless trees. He did not often go out into nature, as you would expect from someone so focussed on it, but used his studio to wander among the trees and try to fathom them. He improvises and searches for his own soul and identity in his paintings, but only through trees. They stand firm and strong and move their leaves flexibly in the wind. Trees and branches emerge, grow, as it were, from the act of painting. In his painting gesture he searches for the power of nature. The metaphorical power of nature is evident in his work: the tree as a metaphor for life.He painted from root to trunk, to crown and back again, with great passion for experimentation. Hundreds of fleeting paintings – not on canvas but on sheets of paper – almost meditatively depict trunk after trunk after trunk after trunk. Sometimes leaning towards the figurative, but often abstract and expressive. Coarse brushstrokes fly across the paper, unclear where trunk becomes root. Sometimes we even see fruits or leaves. Dirven’s work is honest and dedicated to this one form. Through his work as curator of the Vincent van GoghHuis in Zundert – birthplace of the famous painter – his paintings are clearly influenced by Van Gogh: lots of colour and a quick brushstroke with room for emotion. Over time, he used more water in his paintings to give the image space to unfold and give up some control.In repetition of this one form, The Infinite Tree (De Eindeloze Boom) shows the life of the tree and delicately expresses something about the inner world of its creator. With an essay by art historian Rebecca Nelemans.",https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TEC141-300x200.webp,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TEC141_01-1.webp,available,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/the-infinite-tree/
Edges of Landscape,Bas Ketelaars,true,"Is nature a place, an all-encompassing system, or an ideal that we carry within us? The work of Bas Ketelaars (NL) emerges from an interest in the problem of representing nature. A nature that is unreachably far away and yet all around us. Where does culture end and nature begin, or is there really a difference?With the romantic tradition in mind, Ketelaars explores the landscape in a personal and experiential way. Hereby he is interested in both the means of photography and drawing in order to create images where different systems produce the image together. Proximity and distance, space, transparency, densification, or transformation, can be the starting point of his work. In his photographs, he explores the space between the lens and the vista. By using that space, not only the space but also the artist becomes visible. The speed and efficiency of the photograph contrasts with the manual slowness of the drawing. Seclusion in nature becomes seclusion in the studio. Residencies are an important part of Ketelaars’ practice, often as a starting point for creating new work. One of his recent visits was to Białowieza National Park in Poland, famous among biologists for being located in the heart of the largest primeval forest of Europe. Ther he took photographs, often in sequences, moving small details in each image or using filters that he places between the camera and the subject. Always in search of a new representation of nature.Edges of Landscape is a work in itself in which Ketelaars combines his photographic material with drawings in an experimental manner for the first time.Including essays is by Helen Westgeest, Associate Professor of Modern Art History and Theory of Photography and Tim Inghold, Professor of Social Anthropology.",https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TEC139b-300x200.webp,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TEC139_01-3.webp,available,https://www.eriskayconnection.com/edges-of-landscape/
