A Well That Never Dries;Nam Tchun-Mo;false;"Nam Tchun-Mo (*1961) represents a contemporary continuation of the Dansaekhwa movement, a South Korean art movement that was already working in a radically abstract, largely monochrome, and increasingly three-dimensional manner in the 1960s. Through repetitive actions in a meditative painting practice, he creates a contemporary interpretation of „golbeop“ (骨法), a classical principle of East Asian painting that emphasizes the structural vitality and life force of brushwork. He organically traverses tradition and contemporaneity, craftsmanship and abstract form, physicality and spirituality, as well as personal memories and collective cultural experience. The central formal elements of Nam Tchun-Mo‘s practice are lines reminiscent of furrowed fields and elements of traditional architecture such as lattice windows and rafters.
„A Well That Never Dries“ is the second book about and with Nam Tchun-Mo in our program after „Beam Lines Spring Stroke“ (2019) with which we venture away from photography into painting and sculpture, a rare but very welcome excursion for us.
Nam Tchun-Mo lives and works in Daegu, Korea and Cologne, Germany. He exhibits regularly in Korea and Europe, mainly France,Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium.";"19 × 24 cm

Contemporary Perspectives from NRW;Lebensräume;false;"Portraits, open-cast mining, landscape, periphery, industrial architecture, cityscapes, parks, social housing, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Essen, Hürtgenwald… fourteen photographers from NRW undertake an individual inventory of North Rhine-Westphalia in this book. Their photographic series as well as their films concern themselves, for example, with people and their diverse origins, their ways of life, and their social circumstances. Urban architecture and urban change constitute a further focal point, and naturally, the history of the federal state as a transforming industrial and landscape site also plays a role. For all these inquiries into history, memory, and change, photography in general and the photobook in particular represent the predestined medium.
Included Photographers Almourad Aldeeb, Paul Avis, Boris Becker, Frank Dömer, Emine Ercihan, Kathrin Esser, Claudia Fährenkemper, Katharina Kemme, Alexander Lackmann, Jeffrey Ladd, Melina Lehmacher, Gregor Schneider, Gerhard Winkler, Philip Zietmann.

Half Life Chernobyl;Volker Kreidler;false;"On April 26, 1986, at 01:23 a.m. local time, Reactor Block 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant suffered the worst-case scenario in the history of civil nuclear power. Nearly ten years later, in 1995, the Deutsches Hygiene-Museum Dresden commissioned photographer Volker Kreidler to document the aftermath of the catastrophe for the people, the environment, and the landscape. What began as a nature study in 2015 evolved through repeated travels to Kyiv over the past year into a highly topical testimony of the political present in Ukraine. At the heart of the 2025 works is the resilience of the people in Kyiv and the Exclusion Zone, set against the backdrop of the ongoing Russian war of aggression. “The project brings the journey full circle,” says the photographer. “We are returning to the people to whom we already gave a voice in 1995.Today, we are documenting a society standing between destruction and an unconditional determination to pursue a European future.”
With this project, Volker Kreidler presents an extraordinary photographic documentation that traces Ukraine’s transformation from the post-Soviet spirit of change to the current war of defense against Russia.
Volker Kreidler (*1962) has been dedicated to the photographic exploration of Eastern Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. His work navigates the tensions of rapprochement with the West and the associated challenges concerning democracy, education, human rights, and interpersonal relationships";"19,5 cm × 30 cm

Abbild Kontext Zeichen Foto;Manfred Schmalriede;false;"The photo theorist, professor, lecturer, school founder, and author Manfred Schmalriede (*Pforzheim 1937) passed away in the autumn of 2023. He left behind an extensive collection of writings and lectures composed in connection with his teaching activities, as well as for magazines, exhibitions, and book projects. During his lifetime, however, no book was ever published that presented his comprehensive journalistic projects in a collected form. The foundational texts assembled for this volume were still selected jointly by Manfred Schmalriede and the editors. The organization and structure of the book were determined by Silke Helmerding (Professor of Artistic Photography at Pforzheim University) and Jörn Vanhöfen (former student of Manfred Schmalriede, photographer, teacher, and co-founder—along with Manfred Schmalriede and Arno Fischer—of the Fotoschule am Schiffbauerdamm, fas).
About Manfred Schmalriede: Studied Art (HbK Hamburg), followed by studies in History, Art History, and Philosophy (Stuttgart and Tübingen), as well as Aesthetics and Semiotics under Max Bense in Stuttgart. 1971–2002 Professor of Art and Design Theory, Semiotics, and Aesthetics at Pforzheim University; 1979–1991 Lecturer for the History and Theory of Photography at the University of Essen (formerly Folkwang School); 2000–2006 Co-founder and teacher at the Fotoschule Fotografie am Schiffbauerdamm (fas); Workshops on the theory of photography at Cranbrook Academy, MI, and Cleveland State University, Ohio; 2007 Founder of the Neue Schule für Fotografie in Berlin (International Academy for Photography, IAPh), where he played a decisive role as a board member and lecturer.";"17 × 24 cm

Tres Viajes;Jörg Brüggemann;false;"Jörg Brüggemann has traveled to Chile and South America three times. On one of his trips, he drove several thousand kilometers across the continent, capturing landscapes and encounters in his photographs. He was inspired to do so by a dream in which he encountered his deceased mother. On another trip, he photographed political unrest and demonstrations in Valparaíso. The three trips—there are three chapters in the book—are, in their visual language, far more journeys of dreams and feelings—perhaps also in search of himself—than documentary images of places, people, or political circumstances. The three chapters, which are wonderfully distinct from one another in their design and materiality while remaining intertwined, read like narrative strands that cannot be explained immediately, as they leave room for personal discoveries and fantasies. A short personal text by the author continues this narrative style in words. It is also interesting that the photographer, who in his last book pursued a sober topic such as the German autobahn over several years, now shows that a travel narrative can perhaps also be a healing process for oneself and that inner images enable a completely unique, not always explainable approach to the world.
Jörg Brüggemann (*1979) has been a member of the Ostkreuz agency since 2009 and is co-director of the renowned Ostkreuzschule in Berlin.

Buchenwald In the Thicket of the Ettersberg;Christian Rothe;false;"Between 2017 and 2024, the Leipzig-based photographer Christian Rothe (*1986) explored the vast area of the former concentration camp Buchenwald on the Ettersberg near Weimar, using his analog large-format camera. Ruins, barely discernible foundations, stairs, fences and paths appear as topographical scars and signs in the impenetrable thicket. What began as a careful and tentative exploration gradually evolved into an intensive search for traces of history obscured by nature. The black and white photographs enter into a dialog with the poem (Der gefesselte Wald) by José Fosty and literary passages from internationally renowned novels by former concentration camp inmates: Bruno Apitz’s “Naked Among Wolves”, Imre Kertész’s “Fatelessness” and Jorge Semprún’s “What a Beautiful Sunday”. Essays by curator Andrea Karle, chairman of the World Council of Churches, Heinrich Bedford-Strohm and editor Günter Jeschonnek on Christian Rothe’s visual language, the significance of contemporary remembrance culture and commemoration complement the examination of the rupture of civilization and the terror of National Socialism in the immediate vicinity of the town of classicism and great German poets and thinkers. The book was released on the occasion of the eightieth anniversary of the liberation of the Buchenwald concentration camp by the remaining prisoners and the US Army and was presented  for the first time at a matinee on Sunday, April 13, 2025 at the Museum of Forced Labor under National Socialism, Weimar.
After receiving the Award of the Stiftung Buchkunst as “Germanies Most Beautiful Book” of 2025 the first edition sold out quickly. With the help of numerous donors a second edition could be released on January 27 2026, the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, at the State Representation of Baden-Württemberg in Berlin.

India;Ljubodrag Andric;false;"The impressive, large-format pictures by Ljubodrag Andric (*1965) are all the more difficult to categorize the longer the viewer gazes at them. Even though Andric makes use of a camera at the beginning of his creative process, he operates at the interface between photography and painting. Between 2019 and 2024, Andric traveled through India and was inspired by the atmosphere of historical buildings to create works that can be described as geometric abstractions painted with light. A special feature of his work is the tactile quality reminiscent of fresco painting, which is also reflected in the choice of materials for this book. The publication, bound as a “dos-a-dos”, combines two books in one. The classic and equally radical layout by Dutch bookdesigner SYB congenially reflects the visual approach of Ljubodrag Andric’s works. An alternating rhythm of full-page illustrations and double-page details picks up on the impressions and sensations that careful viewers of his originals works may have.
Ljubodrag Andric, born in Belgrade into a family of artists, developed his first photographic and artistic interests at the age of 15. From 1987 onwards, he devoted himself exclusively to photography. From 1987 to 2002, he lived and worked in Rome and Milan before moving to Toronto, Canada. This multicultural biographical background has had a major influence on his work to this day.

Tbilisi Diary;Peter Bialobrzeski;false;"Tbilisi Diary, April 26 – May 4, 2024
May 1, 2024
„By noon, everything seemed to be back to normal. Another much too hot day passes before the anti-Russian law demonstrators take to the streets again in the evening. On X, formerly known as Twitter, you can watch videos of peaceful demonstrators cleaning the streets at 4 a.m., followed by videos of brutal interventions by Speznaz, the special police force, also known locally as Robocops.“
About the City Diaries
In his global, long-term project planned for 50 volumes (begun in 2013), Peter Bialobrzeski poses the question of whether the conception of the image of a city, shaped by prejudices, pre-existing notions, and media representations, can be translated into real images. He is interested in the cultural differences visible in each cityscape. He poses the question of what has already been superimposed by increasing globalization, or what remains visible. With his consistent, seemingly objectifying visual language, this epochal, documentary experiment can be wonderfully comprehended in each book and especially by comparing the individual books, e.g. for New York or Norderney.
Peter Bialobrzeski’s work has been exhibited worldwide. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including two World Press Photo Awards (2003, 2010). In 2012 he was granted the Dr. Erich Salomon Award by the German Photographic Society.
