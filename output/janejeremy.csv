The Land of Haunted Forests,Henry Roy,true,"We are delighted announce the publication of our final title of 2025, The Land of Haunted Forests by Henry Roy. This is our second title that we have published with Henry. The first being Mirage published back in 2014.

Known for its tropical luxuriance, the majesty of its tall trees, and its rebellious spirit, Casamance, the southernmost region Senegal, is a source of fascination.

In this body of work, Henry turns his attention on the animist tradition of the Joola people, who surround themselves with sacred woods and worship the spirits of nature.

Gathering Light,Sam Laughlin,true,"Gathering Light surveys the uplands of Southern Scotland where Laughlin spent six weeks living off-grid as part of a residency with Borders Forest Trust supported by Connecting Threads and The Southern Uplands Partnership. It is a response to a landscape undergoing a programme of ecological restoration which has seen over two million native trees planted across 31km² by Borders Forest Trust, a charity established to restore native habitats in an area with the lowest percentage of native woodland in mainland Scotland.

This work is a meditation on a specific landscape and on the changes slowly unfolding there at differing physical and temporal scales, linked to the seasons, cycles and processes of nature.

“In an abundance of northern light, soaked up and accumulated by the growing trees, I began to see photography and photosynthesis as analogous to one another. Day by day I watched the sun’s path rise to its midsummer zenith. At night I bathed in the light of ancient summers, released from the embers of a fallen Ash tree.” – Sam Laughlin","– 145mm x 200mm
