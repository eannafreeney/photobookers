This Much is True,Albert Elm,false,"Disko Bay is exited to present This Much is True by Albert Elm following his acclaimed debut What Sort of Life is This. The book weaves together Elm’s energetic snapshots and dreamlike landscapes into an original body of work that employs a raw yet playful photographic language. Through this approach, Elm reflects on life as he experiences it—at home and abroad, at this particular moment in time, shaped by his age, circumstances, and surroundings.

The images move freely between faraway places and local experiences, icebergs, swimming pools and deserts. South Asian workers in Dubai, a marble quarry in Carrara, and an industrial pipe system outside Mumbai, alongside tourists photographing the Mona Lisa, graffiti on the separation barrier, and a masked police force in Copenhagen. These scenes are assembled into a fragmented yet coherent visual narrative that feels simultaneously global and deeply personal.
Like many of his generation, Elm navigates a constant storm of information, alternative ways of living, and endless temptations. The images emerge from a desire to understand the many facets of reality and a compulsion to push toward its edges. By refusing hierarchies between the extraordinary and the everyday, the book presents the world as a single, shifting landscape. Elm’s pseudo-documentary approach offers a selective record of lived experience: he captures what feels significant in the moment and preserves it for later reflection. Like a stamp collector filling an album, Elm gathers impressions until an image of a world he can understand — and feel at home in — begins to take shape.
Albert Elm (b. 1990) is a Danish photographer educated at the Glasgow School of Art (2015) and Fatamorgana, the Danish School of Photography (2008). His work has been exhibited internationally and his first photobook What Sort of Life is This (The Ice Plant, 2017) was nominated for the Aperture/Paris Photo First Book Award (2017) and the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Book Award (2017).

Maputo Diary,Ditte Haarløv Johnsen,false,"After more than twenty years photographing life in Mozambique—its people, the city, friends, struggles, addiction, love, togetherness, a sense of belonging, and, generally, everyday life in the Mozambican capital—Haarløv Johnsen created a photographic archive depicting the country’s history, the relationships between people, how they loved, how they suffered, how they stood together, and how they continued to fight for a better future. – Metal Magazine
Disko Bay is proud to present Maputo Diary, a deeply personal and visual masterpiece by the Danish photographer and filmmaker Ditte Haarløv Johnsen. The book brings together 25 years of photographic work from Mozambique’s capital, Maputo — the city where Haarløv Johnsen herself grew up during the civil war and has subsequently returned to over the past two decades.
Through 121 photographs, accompanied by diary notes and new texts, Maputo Diary portrays life, love, and survival among people living on the margins of society, blending social documentary with artistic investigation in images of friends, family, and everyday moments in Maputo. At its heart lies Haarløv Johnsen’s friendship with the “Manas” (“Sisters”) — a group of transgender individuals, many of whom are no longer alive. Maputo Diary stands as both a personal testimony and a universal story — one that finds beauty, dignity, and humanity even in life’s most vulnerable moments.
“Maybe that’s what Maputo Diary is too. An insistence on bearing witness to the lives of others when nobody else was there to make sure they didn’t just disappear.” — Ditte Haarløv Johnsen, Maputo Diary
Ditte Haarløv Johnsen (b. 1977) is an award-winning Danish documentary photographer and filmmaker who grew up in Mozambique, where her parents settled after the country gained independence from Portugal. As a teenager, she moved to Denmark with her father but continued to photograph during her travels back to Maputo, where her mother and youngest sister remained. She has studied at the National Film School of Denmark, Ryerson University in Canada and Fatamorgana – The Danish School of Art Photography. Her award-winning documentary films have been shown at numerous international festivals and the series Maputo Diary has been exhibited in various stages at Brandts, Odense (2006), Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki (2010), Galleri Image, Aarhus (2011), Fotografisk Center, Copenhagen (2013), LaChambre, Strasbourg (2018), The Royal Danish Library, Copenhagen (2021) and Le Centre Culturel Franco-Mozambicain, Mozambique (2024).

New Danish Photography #02,Anthology,false,"The work showcased in New Danish Photography 02 feels unique, relevant, and intentional… Its real people, stories, and landscapes stir up a range of real emotions, and taking the time to sit with those feelings is a beautiful thing. – F-Stop Magazine
We are thrilled  to present the second issue of New Danish Photography, featuring series by Anders Birger, Michella Bredahl, Frederik Danielsen, Peter Funch, Jón Bjarni Hjartarson, Frida Lisa Carstensen Jersø, Louise Herrche Serup and Sarah Hartvigsen Juncker, Anne Lass, Lasse Bak Mejlvang, Mads Nissen, Oliver Thrane and Christian Falck Wolff.
This new issue captures a moment of profound global and digital transformation. As traditional institutions falter and our digital lives are shaped by opaque algorithms and AI-generated content, this printed journal offers an act of resistance: real, human stories told through powerful photographic work. From intimate portraits to scenes of societal fracture, each series invites us to slow down, look closely, and reengage with a reality that still matters.
We have gathered 12 photographic series, each unfolding in their own way moments that might offer a glimpse of understanding and meaning. These vastly different photographers represent a selection of the best and most vital photography in Denmark right now.
“These photographers do not produce content – they document, create art and make photographs. We can’t track engagement or measure our reach, but we can try to create an oasis for contemplation and immersion, where you as a reader might lose yourself for a while.” – From the preface by Emil Ryge
New Danish Photography is a photographic journal established by Disko Bay, Spine Studio and Dansk Dokumentarisme published every other year. The first edition New Danish Photography #01 was published in June 2023. The aim is to look beyond the dichotomy between art and documentary photography as a place to gain our bearings and take stock of Danish Photography right now.

HRTLND,Mads Holm,false,"Shortlisted for Les Rencontres d’Arles 2025 Author Book Award
“The beauty of the photographs lies in their disguised ordinariness.” – Musée Magazine
Disko Bay is thrilled to present HRTLND by Danish photographer Mads Holm. The book is an exploration of life in our rapidly changing world, captured across 20 European and North American countries over the last decade. Through images of urban life, demonstrations, migration and a new military training facility, the book reflects on the paradoxes and tensions shaping modern society, highlighting the double bind between security and control, freedom and surveillance, and the gradual militarization of everyday life.
The book presents a hyperreal landscape where the ordinary is interwoven with the unsettling, challenging the viewer to question what is visible and what remains obscured. In one photo, a child casually bears an assault rifle. In another, a woman dons a garish gas mask, a large drink, and a tote bag in her hands, as she goes about her day. Both these photos bear their abnormalities as if commonplace. The reality is that in our modern times, these abnormalities are only becoming more and more common. In HRTLND Holm captures the undercurrents of global capitalism, militarization, and societal fragmentation, offering a layered narrative that is as much an artistic statement as it is a political act.
Featuring a foreword by acclaimed photographer Donald Weber and five reflective texts by Holm, HRTLND is a profound visual chronicle of our collective condition, offering a stark portrait of the times as of now. The object is a lay-flat softcover wrapped in a French poster jacket with a UTM world map printed on the back. The UTM map are the most used coordinate system in the context of military mission planning. In HRTLND it is highlighting the precise position of each image.
The forces that alter our world today fuse and blend with everyday life and thus become very hard to see. It seeps into everything around and inside of us. It looks like we are being helped to stay safe from all the threats and dangers out there among us. The narrative is that the enemy can be anyone and everywhere and the more we fear that enemy the more there is to secure and thus the more to control. It is smart. The permanent state of emergency is an inexhaustible resource. – From the text Excess of Reality, HRTLND
Mads Holm (b. 1990, Copenhagen) is a Danish photographer and writer whose work explores themes of surveillance, power, and contemporary society. He holds an MA in Photography & Society from the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague and a BA in Fine Art Photography from Glasgow School of Art. He also studied at ICP in New York and attended Fatamorgana, The Danish School of Art Photography. Holm’s work has been exhibited widely across Denmark, the UK, Germany, and the Netherlands. His work has been recognized with several awards and nominations and he has been shortlisted for the MACK First Book Award, Kassel Dummy Award, and Fiebre Dummy Award.

Frida Forever,Frida Lisa Carstensen Jersø,false,"Shortlisted for the Paris Photo–Aperture First PhotoBook Award, Les Rencontres d’Arles Author Book Award and the Fotobus Library Award 
A raw and intimate visual journey through illness, identity, and resilience – i-D
Disko Bay is proud to present Frida Forever by Frida Lisa Carstensen Jersø, a photobook exploring life with chronic illness contrasted with the freedom of youth. The book intertwines photographic self-portraits and staged compositions with energetic snapshots in an original work that uses a raw yet playful photographic style to tell a powerful, personal, and vulnerable story.
In 2012, Frida leaned against a railing on a bridge, which broke, causing her to fall 4.5 meters onto asphalt, breaking her back. Since then, she has been paraplegic and reliant on a wheelchair. In 2018, doctors discovered she also has a cellular abnormality that causes the formation of large, dead calcium deposits. As a result, she has spent much of her adult life in and out of hospitals, undergoing more than 100 surgeries, along with numerous medical treatments and radiation therapy.
During her many hospital stays, she has photographed herself, the hospital space, and her surroundings. The raw and tender images are juxtaposed with depictions of her transition from youth to adulthood, poignantly illustrating the stark duality between freedom and the constraints of illness—a kind of double-edged freedom versus the finite and impermanent state of “being healthy.” With a sharp and intelligent perspective, Frida uses her visual narrative to embrace the experience of being alive and the vulnerability of the human body. The book offers a glimpse into the sick yet capable body, standing at the crossroads of being ill, young, and both simultaneously.
This book is a testament to life in hospital—the physical place to which you are sent when ill. This is where I spend much of my time. But above all, it is about me, Frida. I turn the camera to myself not only because I am often alone, but because my sick body, with its scars, metal implants and all its fragility, is the landscape I know best. It is my specialty. – From the book’s foreword by Frida
Frida Lisa Carstensen Jersø (b. 1997) is a Danish artist living and working in Copenhagen. She holds a Bachelor of Fine Art Photography from HDK Valand in Gothenburg, Sweden. Her work largely revolves around the body and its limitations with a particular interest in exploring the sick body, ableism, and societal perceptions of these topics. Through photography, she examines the physical and emotional aspects of vulnerability and strength. Jersø have exhibited at venues such as Röda Sten Konsthall in Gothenburg and Frederiksborg Castle in Denmark, and have participated in Artists’ Autumn Exhibition 2024 and several other group exhibitions around Scandinavia. Jersø is a part of the European Futures Talent 2025.

The Unposed (EoAT),Michala Paludan,false,"This title is currently on sale and shipping from our Copenhagen studio.
The sheer variety of these so-called End-Of-Arm-Tools (EoATs) is impressive  – Blake Andrews 
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 – Politiken
The Unposed (EoAT) is the first monograph by Danish artist Michala Paludan, it consists of 101 photos of robot “hands”. From 2021-24 Paludan visited many different sites of robotics located in Germany, Denmark, Japan, Korea, and the United States. From digital paws to laser sensors, piano-playing electro-fingers to a not-so-dexterous clamp, this book shows the human hand versioned as high-tech utensil: holders, pinchers, grabbers, supporters, strokers and cutters whose likenesses to the real thing vary according to particularity of their functions.
In the robotics industry, the acronym EoAT refers to End of Arm Tools; that is, a tool required for performing a specific handlike task such as holding, cutting or lifting, and the hardest thing to design on a robot. As the subject of a portrait, the machine – rather than what it produces – is the focus and, in mirroring the hands of human workers, Paludan emphasizes their absence.
Michala Paludan (b. 1983) is a Danish artist currently living and working in Copenhagen. Paludan is a fellow of the Whitney Independent Study Program (2012) and received an MFA from California Institute of the Arts (2011). She studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 2005 to 2009. During the past decade Paludan has framed how power is produced and negotiated across networks and movements, through media such as video, photography and installation. Paludan has exhibited widely in Scandinavia and abroad. Recent exhibitions include: I am Your Body: Automation at Kunsthal Aarhus, Aarhus, Open Shut Them at C.C.C. Gallery, Copenhagen and Our Work at Lunds Konsthall, Lund.

The Name We Hold,Luca Iovino,false,"This title is currently on sale and shipping from our Copenhagen studio. 
On the table, the knife balances on its tip. Levitation turns the ball into a planet, and the coffee maker animates itself like something out of a Walt Disney cartoon – Liberation
This introspective moment becomes a narrative guide, framing his imagery as both a farewell and a hopeful reimagining, as he transforms fear into creative possibility. – Der Greif
Disko Bay are proud to present the dark, fun and mysterious first monograph by Italian photographer Luca Iovino, an exploration of the ritual repetition of the household and the feelings connected to moving from one home to another.
Black and white aesthetics rhythmically enhance the imagery in The Name We Hold. The book explores themes and symbols that guide the photographer in illuminating a fundamental question: where does memory reside? Could it be found within the people themselves, the homes they occupy, or even within the dreamlike and surreal aspects of reality? These elements form a boundary within which Iovino conducts his visual exploration, seeking to define the concept of home and a sense of security during times of displacement and life transitions.
Before leaving my old home, I took the time to look at my surroundings with fresh eyes. I began to question the objects and people that inhabit it. My family, the round mirror, the ball: how could I move them and extract them from their familiar universe? This reflection surprised me, as imagination infiltrated the ordinary. In a way, it also helped me confront my fear of starting over. – Luca Iovino
Luca Iovino is an Italian photographer and artist based in Florence. The Name We Hold won the call #RaccontoPlurale with the Foundation for Modern and Contemporary Art CRT and was shortlisted for Fiebre Dummy Award 2023, Kassel Dummy Award 2023 and BUP Book Award 2023. His work primarily explores the relationship between space and the human being, aiming to establish connections between elements to develop an atlas that neither inscribes structure nor defines borders, but instead seeks to break them open, challenge our certainties, and create a space for new explorations. Iovino has exhibited in Italy, Germany, France and South Korea.

Looking at My Brother,Julian Slagman,false,"Nominated for The Swedish Photo Book Award and Fotobus Library Award 2025
Intimate compositions reveal moments that are by turns pensive and playful, wild and serene. We see the brothers hug, wrestle, swim, run and explore. They pose for revealing close-ups and unknowingly fill the frame for candid shots – Creative Review
The images are intimate and unflinching – DAZED
It’s a beautiful book where each boy takes on a different role as they career through the ages – Colin Pantall, PhMuseum
Disko Bay is thrilled to present Looking at My Brother, the first monograph by German-Dutch photographer Julian Slagman. In this book, Slagman presents work made over the past ten years, photographing his two younger brothers, Mats and Jonah, growing up navigating adolescence and brotherhood.
From individual portraits to shared moments, the images offer a poignant exploration of childhood, growth, and the passage of time. Intimate compositions reveal moments that are by turns pensive and playful, wild and serene. The work deals with the vulnerability of the body and the brutality of the scars that Mats suffered after his scoliosis surgery. These physical reminders juxtapose with the resilience and strength embodied by both brothers. Through the book, Slagman delves into the vulnerable relationship between photography and time, inviting us to witness the tender moments of connection, and a chronicle of brotherhood. 
Within the last ten years, a child became a teenager, and a teenager became an adult. Skin became a photograph and light somehow evolved into a face. When I press the shutter, the viewfinder blacks out in the moment I am taking the picture. The photographic image cuts itself through time on every level. Its surgery. Like a doctor sealing a wound, with careful stitches. Like me, sealing light onto film. I have been photographing my brothers for the last ten years, watching them grow up and seeing myself growing up with them. Like an arrow that never reaches its target, carefully bending around its moment, like flesh that becomes light and wounds made out of time. – Julian Slagman
Julian Slagman (b.1993, Hamburg) is a German-Dutch photographer currently living and working in Malmö, Sweden. He studied photography at Neue Schule für Fotografie in Berlin, HfbK Hamburg and HDK-Valand in Gothenburg under Eva Maria Ocherbauer, Adam Broomberg & Oliver Chanarin and Anna Strand & Annika von Hausswolff. He has exhibited series of works in Deichtorhallen Hamburg and Paris Photo and around Europe including Berlin, Frankfurt, Friedrichshafen, Copenhagen and Gothenburg. Looking at My Brother was awarded the Aenne Biermann Prize in 2021 and shortlisted for the Carte Blanche Students Prize sponsored by Paris Photo.

Disko Bay is proud to present Still Life of Teenagers by Barbara Marstrand; a book that delves into the ways young people engage with the world through photographs of their homes. Centered around the teenage bedroom, the book offers a personal insight into contemporary Danish youth life.
Marstrand’s snapshots capture aspects of everyday life that we often take for granted or perhaps even overlook. Interiors, technology and everyday clutter fill the rooms with information and stories about the lives that unfold within and around them.
“Barbara Marstrand’s photo book offers a keenly observant sociological study of the Danish youth culture of today. What does it look like in the spaces of Danish teens, what do they like to surround themselves with, how do they aestheticise their everyday lives, what preoccupies them? Meanwhile, these details also function as traces of the life lived with and among the objects. We go hunting for signs in the pictures; we sense, feel and construct stories about the rooms’ inhabitants”. – from the opening essay by Mette Sandbye.
Barbara Marstrand (b. 1994) is a self-taught photographer with a degree in sociology from the University of Copenhagen. She is particularly interested in exploring people, places and objects rarely being portrayed, and which tell something unique about our culture and the present time. Still Life of Teenagers is her first book.

The Vulgarity of Being Three-Dimensional,Tine Bek,false,"The Vulgarity of Being Three-Dimensional is an immersive book of works by Danish photographic artist Tine Bek. In this her first monograph Bek tries to escape strict hierarchical structures through a series of aesthetic experiments. The book presents images of shapes that run over, flow, crumble and bulge out. An excess of uncontrolled forms that in the sculptural tradition have been dismissed as vulgar or possibly baroque.
The book is a mix of still life, other found forms and created sculptural forms photographed. Fruit, material, fabric and figures are brought together and changed by subtle shades of colour. Bek’s photography tend to seem uneasy, as if something might go wrong. Her images impose a sense of discomfort, little cracks beneath the surface. It is through these minutiae ruptures in the surfaces she exposes that a material hierarchy forms – is marble better than foam? Does a stone fountain overshadow a bathroom tap? – she asks you to scratch through the surface and to see what’s behind.
Tine Bek (born in 1988) is a Danish visual artist who primarily works with photography, video and sculpture. She studied History before graduated from Fatamorgana – The Danish School of art Photography and Glasgow School of Art, where she holds a Master degree in Fine Art Photography. Bek has exhibited in Denmark, UK, Norway, Lithuania, Germany and USA among others and is represented by Dust and Soul in Madrid and Picture Room in New York. The book has been awarded with the Hasselblad Foundation’s Photo Book Grant 2021.

Self Reflection,Henriette Sabroe Ebbesen,false,"It is curious, vibrant and refreshing to look through Ebbesen’s unique lens – Lisa Giomar Hydén, Director of Exhibitions, Fotografiska Stockholm
The Danish photographer Henriette Sabroe Ebbesen blurs the line between photography and painting, reality and fantasy in an exploration of the human body and the subconscious self in her first monograph Self Reflection. 
Mirrors, reflections and illusions are some of Ebbesen’s photographic tools, where she examines how the human body and mind can be visualized and interpreted by the viewer. The distorted materials, used throughout the book, blur the lines between photography and painting, providing a symbolic boundary between reality and imagination. By placing nature, the nude body, fruits and flowers in a surreal context, Ebbesen creates a clash between the familiar and the odd. The distortions are always created in camera by photographing through various reflections and never by using Photoshop or AI, thus keeping reality close to the surreal.
Formally educated as a Medical Doctor, Ebbesen is interested in the intersection between art and science. Her studies of the psyche, the senses, and the body are seen in many of her works from tattered faces and contorted naked bodies to self-portraits and still life’s.
Henriette Sabroe Ebbesen (b. 1994) is an autodidact photographer and film director from Copenhagen, Denmark. Ebbesen’s works have been exhibited in many places in both Europe and the United States and she has worked for magazines such as Vanity Fair and Vogue. Self Reflection is published with support from Fotografiska Museum Stockholm to accompany her solo exhibition ‘Kaleidoscope’ spring 2024. Henriette is a part of the European Futures Photography program in 2024.

Triple Seven,Anne Lass,false,"One cannot thank Anne Lass enough for preserving these wonderful worlds of postmodern madness in such unique images for posterity. – Nela Eggenberger
I think it is one of the year’s finest titles. Highly Recommended! – Brad Feuerhelm
Leather sofas and fitted carpets, radiant shapes and dark corridors. Disko Bay is thrilled to present Anne Lass’s new colorful book Triple Seven, an immersive documentation of Berlin’s disappearing gambling dens, in a narrative that plays with elements from distant galaxies, exotic islands, and futuristic landscapes.
Red, violet, and blue colors permeate the images, but there’s more at play than just form and color. The Danish-German photographer lived in Berlin from 2007 to 2014, where she was fascinated by the many gambling halls in the Berlin cityscape, most of which was located in the poorer neighborhoods. Lass visited over 100 of Berlin’s approximately 500 small casinos and went on a picture hunt in these often closed and private environments. Here, she documented old machines, gaming tables, and the people who frequented them. Not to condemn, but to try to understand and take the players’ desires seriously: the hope for a better life and the longing for a bit of happiness.
After new legislation came into effect a few years ago, many of the gaming establishments had to close, and over 80% of them have already disappeared, with many of them depicted in this work.
The project sheds light on a phenomenon that is relevant beyond the borders of Berlin – humanity’s eternal pursuit of (financial) happiness. At the same time, it is a visual investigation of the signs, symbols, and objects deliberately used to seduce. It is a photographic record of districts undergoing change due to crises and gentrification, and a documentation of places that have not been extensively explored until now.
Anne Lass (b. 1978) is an acclaimed Danish-German photographer living and working on the island of Bornholm. Her richly descriptive, medium-format color photographs present an eclectic mix of places, objects or individuals rooted in a quiet still life tradition merging documentary form and poetic tenderness. Lass holds a diploma in Documentary Photography from Folkwang Hochschule der Künste and has had multiple solo and group exhibitions in Europe and USA. Her works are included in the collections of Museum of Avantgarde, Danish Arts Foundation and C/O Berlin.

"Killer Machine (the sublime sky, clouds, camouflage smoke disrupting heat seeking missiles, fighter planes removed)",Paula Duvå,false,"This title is currently on sale and shipping from our Copenhagen studio.
Disko Bay is thrilled to present Paula Duvå’s Killer Machine (the sublime sky, clouds, camouflage smoke disrupting heat seeking missiles, fighter planes removed), a book that challenge our perception of the sky delving into a body of work that explores questions of space, technology, and politics.
Paula Duvå takes documentary photography into the hyper-real, as a concrete trace of war, when she documents camouflage smoke trails from fighter jets and missiles captured during various military airshows and demonstrations throughout Denmark. The jets themselves are either gone from the frame or digitally removed, leaving only the traces behind.
In the book, Duvå repeatedly examines the same motif, resulting in a series of landscape photographs that transform the sky images into something reminiscent of war photography. Duvå’s works go beyond merely documenting the beauty of the sky and also delve into the territorial, mythical, and war-filled space that the sky represents. Who owns this space, and what do we truly see when we look up? The work is a comment on the largest single weapon acquisition in Danish history – 27 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets, whereas the first planes are delivered the same week as the book is released.
Paula Duvå (b. 1991) is a photographer and artist based in Copenhagen graduated from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and Glasgow School of Art. She has had multiple gallery and museum exhibition in Denmark, Germany and Sweden. Duvå is the recipient of grants from The Danish Arts Foundation, and her monograph with Disko Bay will be her first publication.

Unprofessional,Matilde Søes Rasmussen,false,"This title is sold out.
Through photography and text, Danish artist Matilde Søes Rasmussen explores her time as a professional model in Asia. Having spent more than a decade in the industry, she now turns her attention to questioning its power structures, beauty ideals, and objectification. Unprofessional is a playful and crushing book that moves between documentary and fiction, performance and real life, wherein Rasmussen uses her own body to investigate how these structures impact her self-image and identity.
The book is a mix self-portraits alongside still lifes, landscapes, and photographs of friends and acquaintances. We see fruits cut in half, a naked back and the model sitting lost in a studio wearing a green fur and swim flippers. A kaleidoscope of colour and form envelops her as she shapeshifts through the pages: hair spiky then slicked; makeup natural then extreme; naked then exquisitely dressed. Short texts, almost like diary entries, punctuate the book, revealing Rasmussen’s first-hand experiences and reflections. Unprofessional is an attempt to find meaning in a career as a model, as an ever-changing character, and as something that is constantly being assessed, bought and admired.








Matilde Søes Rasmussen (born in 1990) is a Danish artist who primarily works with text, video and photography. She graduated from Fatamorgana – The Danish School of art Photography and Academy Valand in Gothenburg, where she holds a bachelor’s degree in Fine Art Photography. In addition, she has participated in the renowned Atelier Smedsby program in Paris with the artists JH Engström & Margot Wallard and in 2021 she received a one-year working grant from The Swedish Arts Council. Rasmussen lives and works in Gothenburg, Sweden and in Copenhagen, Denmark.
