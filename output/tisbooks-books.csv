Sacred Place,Balarama Heller,true,"Shortlisted for Paris Photo–Aperture Photobook Awards
The Smithsonian magazine - The Ten Best Photography Books of 2025
VSCO's Favorite Photobooks of 2025
NY Times In Development: New works at the intersection of art, news and life.
Balarama Heller’s Sacred Place was created in the predawn hours, when the veil between the spiritual and material realms is thinnest. It is a deeply personal yet universally resonant pilgrimage exploring faith, memory, and spiritual transformation. Born into the Hare Krishna movement in America, Balarama Heller grew up within a world of devotion, ritual, and upheaval—moving through communes, countercultures, and moments of both transcendence and disillusionment. Returning to Vrindavan, India, the heart of the religion, Heller, guided by Joseph Campbell’s idea that sacred places reveal “eternity shining through time,” crafts an alchemical tapestry of archetypes both ancient and new. Sacred Place sifts through the magnetism forged by millennia of pilgrims—Heller himself among them—seeking to touch the Infinite glimmering through the present.

Balarama Heller (b. 1979, New York) is a New York City-based transmedium visual artist whose work explores the intersection of spirituality, myth, ritual, and science. Working between abstraction and representational spaces, Heller’s practice reimagines archetypal symbols, creating a visual language of preverbal awareness and photographic sublimation.
After receiving his BFA from the Art Institute of Boston in 2001 and working at Magnum Photos, Heller joined the U.S. Merchant Marines before relocating to Istanbul to document ritual and ascension throughout Eastern Europe and the Middle East. He returned to New York in 2010.
Recent group exhibitions include Illuminations, curated by Dana Karwas at Yale University’s CCAM (2025), and Poetic Record, curated by Deana Lawson and Michael Famighetti at Princeton University (2024).
Pico Iyer is the author of 17 books—translated into 23 languages—on subjects ranging from the Dalai Lama to the Cuban Revolution, from the new global era to the art of stillness. For more than four decades, he has been a regular essayist for Time, The New York Times, The Financial Times, and many other leading publications worldwide. Several of his recent books have been national bestsellers.",https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/SacredPlace-BalaramaHeller-TISbooks-01-ParisAperture_833cc3ba-09d2-43b4-bb79-5410a88f1fd3.jpg?v=1760627187&width=4375,https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/SacredPlace-BalaramaHeller-TISbooks-print-edition_2563cc67-663a-4b68-9fb5-13bafc736f8f.jpg?v=1765311564&width=4472|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/SacredPlace-BalaramaHeller-TISbooks-04.jpg?v=1765311564&width=3750|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/SacredPlace-BalaramaHeller-TISbooks-05.jpg?v=1765311564&width=3750|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/SacredPlace-BalaramaHeller-TISbooks-08.jpg?v=1765311564&width=3750|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/SacredPlace-BalaramaHeller-TISbooks-07.jpg?v=1765311564&width=3750,available,https://www.tisbooks.pub/products/sacred-place-balarama-heller
COLLIDER,Carl Wooley,true,"When our daughter was a year old, my wife’s work brought us to Geneva, Switzerland for several months. I spent my days looking after our daughter, often taking her on long walks in her stroller through quiet residential streets, along the edges of the lake, and out into the surrounding countryside. We were exploring this place together—it was new for me, and everything was new for her.
Just beyond the city’s edge lies CERN, home of the Large Hadron Collider. I had somehow imagined we’d be able to tour the massive underground facility, which of course was not possible without special clearance. Instead, my daughter and I visited the modest, almost nondescript museum above. Behind a plexiglass case sat what was said to be the first computer used to host the World Wide Web, used by scientists at CERN to collaborate more easily and eventually to share their findings with colleagues around the world.
Sitting in her stroller, my daughter was oblivious to the machine’s significance, just as she was to the miles-long circular tunnel beneath our feet, where particles were being accelerated to tremendous speeds and smashed together to recreate conditions last seen when the universe was less than a trillionth of a second old. Cathedral-sized chambers housed enormous instruments designed to decipher the meaning of those collisions.
As I looked out the window at the quiet countryside, I didn’t know what to make of it all—the strange and wondrous things we humans build, and the silences we break open, to look beyond the limits of our understanding.",https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/ColliderCover_8b5deb42-4e43-4297-8bde-c39a42a0af00.jpg?v=1759260334&width=3726,https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/Collider-v5-text-block-updatedcolophon2.jpg?v=1758203929&width=3500|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/Collider-v5-text-block-updatedcolophon5_d5370eb4-7f9c-4849-b17f-0022a34fe65d.jpg?v=1758203929&width=3500|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/Collider-v5-text-block-updatedcolophon10_4a1a697e-a85d-4754-8a3a-5b679ffe7ebf.jpg?v=1758203929&width=3500|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/Collider-v5-text-block-updatedcolophon15_224d4062-c9b8-46ff-8566-38a90e4bd78c.jpg?v=1758203929&width=3500|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/Collider-v5-text-block-updatedcolophon16_01b524f2-c691-4e86-94e5-3b54c6c0ff73.jpg?v=1758203929&width=3500,available,https://www.tisbooks.pub/products/collider-carl-wooley

Lenscratch - Elijah Howe / MIKE
Decibel Magazine - MIKE: Elijah Howe’s Poignant Tribute to His Father, Metal Church Vocalist Mike Howe

Through a mix of family archive photos and Elijah Howe’s own images, MIKE is a son’s reflection on the life of his father, seen through the eyes of those closest to him. From his youth as the lead singer of a heavy metal band to his quieter, middle-aged years as a husband and father, the photographs build a layered portrait of Mike Howe’s identity. Yet, after his death, the narrative unravels into chaos and emptiness, conveying the profound and unsettling impact of loss. MIKE is a poignant look at how we remember and carry those who have passed, revealing how absence can be as powerful as presence.
Elijah Howe is a photographer from Humboldt County, California. He received his BA in photography from Humboldt State University and his MFA from the University of Kentucky. He has recently had solo shows at 2nd Story Gallery and Bolivar Gallery in Lexington, Kentucky and has work in the permanent collection of the Monroe Moosnick Medical and Science Museum at Transylvania University.
Mike Howe (August 21, 1965 – July 26, 2021) was an American heavy metal singer who performed with Metal Church, Heretic, and Snair. After leaving Metal Church, Mike pursued a career in carpentry and was a father to two sons. He rejoined Metal Church in 2015, producing two more albums before his death in 2021.",https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/MikeCover_27bea752-f953-4c87-ab53-00dc77008a49.jpg?v=1751346444&width=1500,https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/MIKE_ElijahHowe_TISbooks_spread_02.jpg?v=1751340002&width=4500|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/MIKE_ElijahHowe_TISbooks_spread_06.jpg?v=1751340002&width=4500|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/MIKE_ElijahHowe_TISbooks_spread_08.jpg?v=1751340002&width=4500|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/MIKE_ElijahHowe_TISbooks_spread_10.jpg?v=1751340002&width=4500|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/MIKE_ElijahHowe_TISbooks_spread_14.jpg?v=1751340002&width=4500,available,https://www.tisbooks.pub/products/mike-elijah-howe
tell my love now,Sara Aue Sobol,true,"Sara Aue Sobol’s tell my love now weaves together two distinct winter journeys, separated by time and place but mirroring and informed by each other in her experience of them. As Sobol’s husband, Jacob, faced clinical depression, it became a catalyst for Sara to look back on the photographs she had taken in Russia years earlier, from a time when the country was more open. Through that process, she began reflecting on the evolution of her bond with Jacob, viewing the images as a lens through which to embrace both their past and present love story.
These photographs gave Sara a way to try to understand and connect with her husband, who in many ways had disappeared into a distant world. At the same time, it gave her a new perspective on her prior work in Russia, itself an exploration of a country on the cusp of disappearing.
Both journeys--healing from a depression and her travels in Russia--explore a longing for closeness.
Through a combination of text and images, portraits and everyday stories, Sobol’s work explores both outer and inner landscapes and the struggle to keep our minds free in the face of repression, whether personal or collective, and celebrates the complexity of love.",https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/TIS_4-14-2510269-closeup_9efafb81-e9f4-48f2-9f39-0ccee0350943.jpg?v=1750974500&width=5000,https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/TIS_4-14-2510259.jpg?v=1750974510&width=5000|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/TIS_4-14-2510282.jpg?v=1750974575&width=5000|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/TIS_4-14-2510289.jpg?v=1750974575&width=5000|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/TIS_4-14-2510291.jpg?v=1750974575&width=5000|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/TIS_4-14-2510297.jpg?v=1750974575&width=5000,available,https://www.tisbooks.pub/products/tell-my-love-now-sara-aue-sobol

You’ve Loved Me Before: Gaia Giani interviews Shane Hallinan

It was very easy before cell phones, the internet and social media to lose track of people, to not know how to reach them, to forget their names, their faces. People could be really important to you but if you lost touch with them they became a footnote, a ""whatever happened to?"" question for someone you ran into. What Shane was doing with her images, then and forever after, was marshaling against forgetting.
By photographing the experience of simply being in someone's life, she bore witness to the day to day memories that create a friendship, a family. The little moments, the big moments, the in-between. And there was so much in between. Hours on the phone, aimless driving to nowhere, endless hanging out in diners, bedrooms, kitchens, anywhere really. Boring and mundane but also beautiful and transformative.
To be seen by her was a gift. Is a gift.

The Crisis Tapes – the debut monograph of photographer Charlie Simokaitis – is an account of his daughter’s gradual loss of the ability to see, and of her powerful psychological response to an imminent, and presumably diminished, reality. Depression and circular episodes of mental un-wellness pervaded her life for several years, and reverberated within the family, like a reoccurring grieving process. Over time, Simokaitis and his wife found that they had assumed the role of subjective interpreters of the visible world – the descriptions of their surroundings, objects, and phenomena becoming manifestly more exacting and streamlined. While their daughter, retreating from life, sought refuge in a forest of her own making, Simokaitis as photographer drew from the emotionally heightened disorientation, rage and confusion of their everyday life – a life, for his daughter, that was growing narrower by degrees, in which the act of seeing itself was being thoroughly considered.",https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20240920_123123-Edit.jpg?v=1727716258&width=4472,https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20240920_123302-Edit.jpg?v=1727716258&width=4472|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20240920_123406-Edit.jpg?v=1727716258&width=4472|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20240920_123552-Edit.jpg?v=1727716258&width=4472|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20240920_123645-Edit.jpg?v=1727716258&width=4472|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20240920_123703-Edit.jpg?v=1727716258&width=4472,available,https://www.tisbooks.pub/products/the-crisis-tapes-charlie-simokaitis

With Mi’raj (Arabic for “ladder” or “ascension”), his first full length monograph with TIS books, J Carrier builds upon ideas explored in his book Elementary Calculus (MACK, 2012): notions of distance and destination, of hope and providence. He also scrutinizes more recent preoccupations: faith, futility, and the possibility of transcendence. Working over several years, Carrier chose to survey the Old City, East and West Jerusalem, and other areas in the West Bank, engaging directly with the real and tangible artifacts of thousands of years of history and belief. Using an iterative and recursive process, Carrier’s result is a deft photographic landscape woven from the fragments of parallel and divergent realities.
—
Al-Isra’ wal-Mi’raj describes the journey taken by the prophet Muhammad with the angel Gabriel, from the ‘farthest place’ – the site of the modern day Al Aqsa Mosque in the Old City – to Heaven. This site is not only sacred to Muslims, but also to Jews as The Temple Mount, location of the First and Second Temples, and to Christians – where God created Adam from dust, and where Jacob, his head pillowed on stones, dreamt of angels.
The narrative of the prophet Muhammad’s ascension provided a framework for Carrier to explore the universal idea of human aspiration. In looking, we find ourselves at limits – physical, spiritual, existential – reckoning with the materials of the world – facades and stones. “It’s both examination and exhumation,” he says. “Through these concrete objects, the immaterial essence of a land rent between the sacred, the ideological and the actual is revealed.”",https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/Untitled-1.jpg?v=1702062603&width=3419,https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20231115_191805_e2b6feb7-09e9-4aca-87e0-d45614a23e04.jpg?v=1702062603&width=3973|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20231115_203013_50679d35-814b-4db5-bc1c-d0c48dc7d5da.jpg?v=1707335029&width=4472|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/Untitled-1-2.jpg?v=1707335029&width=2500|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/TIS_Miraj_v2.2-textblock2_9a233000-5ea8-4335-acc3-ef700910ac3c.jpg?v=1707335029&width=4472|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/TIS_Miraj_v2.2-textblock12_b56e6d27-85c9-4d47-b36a-2107f10bf35c.jpg?v=1707335029&width=4472,available,https://www.tisbooks.pub/products/miraj-j-carrier

Another Mag: Clifford Prince King’s Moving Portraits of Black, Queer Intimacy
British Journal of Photography - The photobooks not to miss this autumn

Clifford Prince King moved to Orange Grove in 2016 with friend and collaborator Malcolm Marquez. They shared a warm two-bedroom in the Burbank hills, tucked into a leafy courtyard within walking distance of the Sprouts, where King worked the early shift. 
The photographs from this time detail the spectrum of exploration, bliss, and transformation that comes with burgeoning queerness in a new creative, social, and physical landscape that shaped the ethos of these two artists’ creative practices. 
Orange Grove is dark and handsome, filled with King’s warm and intricate portraits that flow like tapestries while witnessing lovers and friends in the ether of vulnerability. With eyes wrapped around each other, King’s portraits remind the viewer that sex and intimacy are intrinsically collaborations.
King makes the everyday transparent while embracing the fantasy of the daydream. Romance in Libra demands balance, doesn’t it? A night comes and goes, but what if the moment could last forever? Fingers interlaced, a slow dance in the kitchen, post-hookup eyes.
Orange Grove is an orbital chart filled with many lives and connections. King is not the center, but he touches all as he traverses new realities of desire and intimacy. Woven into the narrative is King’s 2018 HIV diagnosis, and the subsequent shifts in the body that illness brings. Sheets dampened from night sweats transpose to pills on two tongues and an arm around the shoulder.
A bedroom is a place of mending, dreaming, and f**king. Orange Grove was a home. An altar to domesticity washed in the spirit of an evolving understanding of what is queer and black and masculine (not necessarily in that order). 
You’re invited in. You’re taken care of. There are books you’ve never read, knick knacks on the shelf, a meal placed before you. Lay down on the floor and gaze around or you’ll miss what’s present. King holds his own dearly with intrigue and grace. Orange Grove captures with precision the wonder of companionship and the beauty of developing selfhood.

Clifford Prince King is an artist living and working in New York and Los Angeles. King documents his intimate relationships in traditional, everyday settings that speak on his experiences as a queer black man. In these instances, communion begins to morph into an offering of memory; it is how he honors and celebrates the reality of layered personhood. Within King's images are nods to the beyond. Shared offerings to the past manifest in codes hidden in plain sight, known only to those who sit within a shared place of knowledge. Public collections holding his work include the Hammer Museum, Kleefeld Contemporary Art Museum, Los Angeles County Museum of Arts, ICA Miami, Minneapolis Institute of Art and Studio Museum in Harlem. King has recently exhibited work at Jeffrey Deitch Gallery (Los Angeles), Higher Pictures (New York City), Leslie Lohman Museum (New York City), Light Work (Syracuse, NY), MASS MoCA, Marc Selwyn Gallery (Beverly Hills), and Stars Gallery (Los Angeles).

Museé Magazine - Exhibition Review: Andrea Modica: Theatrum Equorum

The result of more than eight years of intense work in Italy and elsewhere, Theatrum Equorum is acclaimed photographer Andrea Modica’s latest monograph with TIS books.
As the title indicates, Modica’s interest lies in the drama of the horse – but her approach is one that completely upends expectations for such an exploration. Using her trademark 8 in x 10 in large format camera, she made these photographs at a renowned horse clinic in Bologna that attracts remarkable and often very valuable animals for a range of medical procedures including, among other things, fracture repairs, emergency colic intervention and dental work.
“When I was invited to witness an operation, I was immediately drawn to the contrast of these magnificent animals rendered so vulnerable,” Modica says. “I instantly wanted to investigate with my camera.” She began the project by making pictures of the horses in their post-operative recovery rooms: simple padded stalls with overhead windows that produce a lovely, soft light. To protect the animals as they emerge from anesthesia, the floors are carefully covered with the surgeon’s shredded junk mail, old medical journals, and art magazines. “The stalls are at once theatrical stages and humble boxes. In my photographs the horses are in an anesthetic sleep,” the artist notes. “There’s something sacred about the animals and the process of being able to go through this with them—a state of extreme vulnerability for an animal of that power.”
What followed was an obsessive visual study of the surgical tools, both before and after procedures, as well as a photographic examination of phantoms: curious “false” mares used for reproductive purposes. This part of the project took Modica to facilities in Italy as well as the United States, including visits to clinics in Maryland, Kentucky, and Florida. As such, Theatrum Equorum connects her previous work in Italy (published in such books as l’Amici del Cuore and Reveal) with her American works January 1, As We Wait, Human Being, Fountain, Treadwell, and Minor League, among many others.
Andrea Modica is a professor at Drexel University’s Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts & Design and is a Guggenheim Fellow, a Fulbright Scholar, and the recipient of a Knight Award. An exhibition of the photographs contained in Theatrum Equorum runs June 15 through December 11, 2022, at the Philip and Muriel Berman Museum of Art on the Ursinus College campus in Collegeville, Pennsylvania.",https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20221026_180250.jpg?v=1702068745&width=4447,https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/TheatrumEquorum.00_00_22_17.Still002.jpg?v=1667246913&width=3840|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20221026_182816_975b2d24-c347-4c83-8847-f11338c02fc0.jpg?v=1702068745&width=4472|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20221026_182857_30da0816-75d8-42b7-8a84-3f806ecf4faf.jpg?v=1702068745&width=4472|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20221026_183731_9f1764e8-cece-4f6f-a892-811d73f24073.jpg?v=1702068745&width=4472|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/20221026_201004.jpg?v=1702068745&width=4472,available,https://www.tisbooks.pub/products/theatrum-equorum

Jenia Fridlyand uses a 4x5 view camera with flexibility and subtlety, rendering not only considered landscapes, but also domestic scenes of surprise and spontaneity. One senses ultimately the climate (literally and figuratively) of the valley in which her family is making a new home for itself. The simplest activities of housekeeping – eating and sleeping, planting and harvesting the garden, playing chess – are imbued with joy and gratitude in juxtapositions of interior and exterior life.
In 2017, Jenia Fridlyand created an artist’s book that sold out its limited run quickly and was shortlisted for the Paris Photo-Aperture First Photobook Prize.

HORIZONT. Not a thing exactly, but rather “a condition called an entire city built on a city built on a city built on a city built on a city built on a city built on a city,” says Anne Boyer. The layering and invisibility of a palpable but still incoherent history. A sense of the space between objects that has a presence as powerful as the objects. The omnipresent trees and undergrowth.

A Dozen Failures,John Gossage,true,"Press

While walking with (podcast)

A Dozen Failures is both a singular statement as a photobook and a commentary on a life spent making some of the classic photobooks of our time, among them The Pond, There and Gone, The Romance Industry, and Berlin in the Time of the Wall.
Every photograph is in some way perfect (as a technical feat) and in another way a failure (as representational “residue”). So what makes a picture a “failure” – something worthy of further contemplation? It goes far deeper than merely being a mistake. Failures teach us about life and the self in ways as powerful as – and far more confoundingly than – successes.
Or, as Gossage says, they show us “a love lost through lack of skill and misunderstanding.”",https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20230123_193447.jpg?v=1702064214&width=4472,https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/ADozenFailures.00_00_26_14.Still001.jpg?v=1652537083&width=3840|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/20160407_103346.jpg?v=1702064214&width=2048|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/20160407_103510.jpg?v=1702064214&width=2048|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/20160407_103745.jpg?v=1702064214&width=2048|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/20160407_103825.jpg?v=1702064214&width=2048,available,https://www.tisbooks.pub/products/a-dozen-failures
Black Threads from Meng Chiao,Justine Kurland,true,"In a true collaboration, Justine Kurland and John Yau shared photographs and poems throughout the making of Black Threads from Meng Chiao, each reacting to the work of the other many times over. The result is a revelation for each: Kurland's intimate interior black-and-white images offer a new side of an artist known for large-format color pictures of landscapes both peopled and not; Yau's spare, precise language is given room to reveal multiple layers of meaning over the three distinct formal sections that comprise the title poem.
A friendship between these two was born several years ago after Yau - also a renowned critic - wrote about Kurland's photographs, but an artistic partnership wasn't contemplated until they recently found themselves in similar mental and emotional situations born of quite different logistical circumstances. Yau was housebound while recuperating from knee and neck surgeries, and Kurland was off the road (her accustomed place of working), caring for her son in the East Village. It was, in Kurland's words, a period of ""house arrest, or being shipwrecked"" for both.
Kurland turned away from the 4x5 film camera and its slow working process to embrace the immediacy of a digital SLR and its instant results, producing tight interior shots as claustrophobic and caged as she felt. Through the magic of email, she shared the raw results with Yau, who responded both to the specifics of her images and to the way he was feeling as a person whose full, unfettered mobility had been temporarily removed from him. The idea of Meng Chiao's Black Threads came from that poet's late poems, in which he wrote sequences comprised of interconnected (or, to Yau's thinking, echoing) lyrics. Yau started the sequence after he was unable to find the book in his library, and took this as a sign to begin writing in the space of its absence.
In turn, the photographer internalized the poet's ideas to spur the making of new pictures, and the process was repeated several times. Kurland says the result is like ""staring out a window at a brick wall across the alley"" - finding some way to deal with adverse situations and making sense of them through the creation of something new in the world.",https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/20221209_202132_995aa9bd-1a19-458a-bebb-423dfd370319.jpg?v=1670625854&width=3634,https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/20221209_153817.jpg?v=1670770673&width=800|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/BlackThreadsfromMengChiao.00_00_36_02.Still001.jpg?v=1652537348&width=3840|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/Spread_03_f621c6bb-11c6-4b60-bf05-8e434001432a.jpg?v=1670770673&width=2048|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/Spread_05_4c017b8e-4e81-4197-84b6-b89edeace64d.jpg?v=1670770673&width=2048|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/Spread_02_1bb95fa9-5b56-48e5-bf3f-196f28ff68a9.jpg?v=1670770673&width=2048,available,https://www.tisbooks.pub/products/black-threads-from-meng-chiao

The Cold War was escalating, the Russians were going to attack soon, and we had better stop touching ourselves. I didn’t really have any hopes or dreams then. I just wanted to live long enough to get married and have sex before God called us Home. 
Such is the backdrop for Steven B. Smith’s new monograph, Waiting out the Latter Days, in which time does seem suspended. Where everyone is in a perpetual state of waiting. Whether the next thing will be better or worse . . . well, it’s hard to say.
But until then, we can take solace in Smith’s unvarnished assessment of his past and present, rendered in photographs that are simultaneously as precise and as enigmatic as the light in Utah.",https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20230123_193657.jpg?v=1702064152&width=4472,https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/WOTLD.00_00_21_05.Still001.jpg?v=1652537765&width=3840|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/20150428_185925.jpg?v=1702064152&width=2048|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/20150428_190018.jpg?v=1702064152&width=2048|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/20150428_190033.jpg?v=1702064152&width=2048|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/20150428_190051.jpg?v=1702064152&width=2048,available,https://www.tisbooks.pub/products/waiting-out-the-latter-days
The Stick,Justine Kurland,true,"The Stick weaves together Justine Kurland’s latest series of searingly intimate black-and-white photographs with her late father Bruce Kurland’s still life paintings. The two bodies of work—punctuated by poems by Lisa Jarnot, a former lover of Bruce Kurland’s—enact a new kind of family album, full of strange relics and mercurial artistry that link father and daughter. Boarded-up windows, a pregnant dog, chewing gum vulvas, and a former partner’s strap-on are in conversation with Bruce Kurland’s surreal compositional inventions—flowering branches draped with strips of raw bacon, a ripe cleaved peach seemingly levitating against a blue wall, and dematerialized birds dangling in space. Seen in tandem, the photographs take on the dreamlike uncanniness of the paintings and the symbolism of the still lifes finds embodied sensuality in the photographs.
Justine Kurland’s work in The Stick is the first she has published since selling her van four years ago and renouncing the road trips she is known for. This series unfolds across her apartment in New York City, her hometown of Fulton, New York, and her mother’s home in rural Virginia. Kurland invaginates fragments of this life with allusions to the work of Carolee Schneemann, Betty Tompkins, Judy Chicago, Hannah Wilke, and Emily Roysdon. Three of her father’s paintings—a diminutive portrait of himself wearing a pot as a hat, a likeness of Justine Kurland’s mother, and his final self-portrait before his death—appear in her work, linking disparate slices of life, spaces that are and were once called home, and notions of family across time and place.
Bruce Kurland (1938–2013) studied at the Arts Students League and the National Academy School of Fine Arts in New York City. A retrospective of his work, Bruce Kurland: Insight into Still Life, was organized by the Burchfield Center for Western New York Art in 1983. His work is held in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.
Justine Kurland (b. 1969) studied at the School of Visual Arts and Yale University.

One Star and a Dark Voyage,Barbara Bosworth,true,"In her first monograph with TIS books, the much-heralded photographer Barbara Bosworth has interwoven the visceral and ethereal to visually build a sense of the delicate and fragile nature of life, at a place where the edges of heaven and earth blur.
These pictures, made with Bosworth’s customary 8x10 camera, speak to our connections with nature: bear paws hauntingly human, roses cut to bring beauty indoors, names carved into a tree trunk declaring one’s love forever.
In One Star and a Dark Voyage, we are brought into intimate communion with such things as a wound on a sun-freckled shin, a worm as stigmata in a child’s hand, a bird lying in a cupped hand, a body hovering in the darkness, the spot where an elk slept – all evoking the ephemeral nature of life.
“This work began as a way for me to think about life and death and about our ties with nature and our utter dependence on earth, and later, after the death of a loved one, blurred into images about the exquisite fragility of life, about loss and longing,” as Bosworth explains. “I began looking for light in the darkness. Fireflies as I try to hold onto the light. The simple beauty of light falling on leaves. A rainbow, the sunset, the Milky Way.” 
The result: a book as journey, where weight becomes light. The beautiful and the terrible, all interconnected, all the same. Always seeking home.",https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20230123_192052_ed7adcbb-d82f-4b75-a54a-9fe9684cd5dd.jpg?v=1702070996&width=4472,https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/OneStarandaDarkVoyage.00_00_31_04.Still001.jpg?v=1652450614&width=3840|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/TISbooks_OneStar_38.jpg?v=1702070996&width=4472|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/TISbooks_OneStar_12.jpg?v=1702070996&width=4472|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/TISbooks_OneStar_21.jpg?v=1702070996&width=4472|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/TISbooks_OneStar_60.jpg?v=1702070996&width=4472,available,https://www.tisbooks.pub/products/one-star-and-a-dark-voyage

In her debut monograph, Cromwell expresses a deep and complex view of Havana.
El Libro Supremo de la Suerte gathers photographs from Cromwell’s largest body of work to date, made in Havana over a span of seven years. The title translates as “The Supreme Book of Luck” and refers to photocopied booklets used to navigate the covert lottery in Havana. Cubans refer to these booklets, or charadas, to match everyday objects and experiences to numbers; these meanings are by turns straightforward (85 is “clock”), mystical (60 refers to “dark sun”), and idiosyncratic (98 is “old prostitute”). Cromwell found parallels between this intentional look at everyday things and the way she makes pictures. “A turtle on the sidewalk, a can of red paint — these were simple moments that by the act of photographing were made more meaningful and monumental. It was a similar gesture to what people did when they picked lottery numbers,” she says.
Not unlike the way a lottery system attempts to harness the fickle concept of luck, this book organizes Cromwell’s richly colored and affective images through a design that conveys the chaotic, multisensorial, and disorienting character of Havana. Developed in collaboration with designer Ben Salesse, El Libro Supremo de la Suerte reflects the nonlinear narrative of Cromwell’s experience and suggests the randomness inherent not only to the lottery but also to life in this Caribbean city. “I came of age in Havana, not only as a person, but also an artist. This work is an homage to my experience of a specific geography. I am honoring the symbols and occurrences that have shaped my understanding of a place and time. I documented my relentless search for intimacy and spirituality, while navigating the politics of my presence in Cuba, as photographer and ultimately an outsider.”
This debut publication conveys the photographer’s distinctive practice of describing a place by enmeshing herself in its culture. Cromwell disavows any sense of objectivity, guided by a lucid understanding that the photographer is as much part of what she depicts as the elements or people in front of the lens. As Paula Kupfer writes: “In exploring the visual connections between numbers — exact and absolute units of measurements — and the mystical, wayward ways of luck, as embodied by friends and family performing for her camera, Cromwell offers a lyric homage to Cuba, the place that’s shaped her practice and that, moreover, continues defying expectations and interpretations.”
El Libro Supremo de la Suerte is co-published by Light Work, which bestowed the book with the Light Work Photobook Award 2018. The Award is given each year to an artistic project that deserves international attention. As with all of Light Work’s programs, in selecting the artists to receive this recognition an emphasis is made to highlight emerging and underrepresented artists of diverse backgrounds.",https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/20221209_202646_83be727d-bb4c-444a-829e-44431493de84.jpg?v=1670625887&width=4472,https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/20221209_153655.jpg?v=1670770699&width=800|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/ElLibro.00_02_41_12.Still001.jpg?v=1652537421&width=3840|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/RoseMarieCromwell_ElLibro_02.jpg?v=1670770699&width=2048|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/RoseMarieCromwell_ElLibro_03.jpg?v=1670770699&width=2048|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/RoseMarieCromwell_ElLibro_04.jpg?v=1670770699&width=2048,available,https://www.tisbooks.pub/products/el-libro-supremo-de-la-suerte

TIS03: Black Alchemy: if this one thing is true,Aaron Turner,true,"also comes as part of a 12 book box set, TIS03
Black Alchemy: if this one thing is true (2020) addresses my thoughts on modern-day conversations around identity, marginality, abstraction, aesthetics, and ontology. I take direct inspiration from fellow artists' words, historical events, and my family archive to create this body of work. As so in past and ongoing iterations of Black Alchemy (2014 - present), my goal is to use Black Alchemy's lens to explore what ""black art"" is and what a black artist is, concerning the black experience's representation. It also addresses the discourse of photography, and re-questioning social and racial justice, while engaging abstraction as a tool to shift questions of identity within an established, often monolithic historical narrative.

TIS03: The Views,Yael Malka,true,"also comes as part of a 12 book box set, TIS03
In 2013, NYC instituted a law that requires “viewing panels” at every construction site, allowing passersby in the neighborhood visual access to the changes occurring beyond the wooden walls placed around the site. The intention behind these viewing panels began as a way of providing transparency to the public though in actuality the construction of these new buildings is centered on an opaque process that feels especially surreptitious in the context of gentrification. These “windows” give the illusion of access although they are displayed in a way that reminds us they are only there for the interim. 
The luxury developments consuming many of the neighborhoods in New York (and many other American cities as well as many abroad) begin with a visual language of violence. Photographed at various stages of demolition and construction, the viewing panels become portals; the boundary between public and private through the obstruction of the wooden walls. They become voids; the erasure and envelopment of space. These windows give different messaging to those who are being priced out of their neighborhoods and the incoming gentrifiers. They subtly placate the population facing gentrification and by contrast, provide reassurance to the gentrifiers by displaying that ""progress"" is being made.
Coded language such as beautification, revitalization and renewal are used to veil the gradual displacement of people who make up these neighborhoods in which immense developments are being built. Homogeneity takes over and cities across the States (apart from their recognizable skylines) become visibly interchangeable. There’s this “utopia” that many city planners and developers strive for, although in doing that, they are wholly disregarding people and social relations.

TIS03: Eclipse,Rose Marie Cromwell,true,"also comes as part of a 12 book box set, TIS03
Rose Marie Cromwell had a brush with death not once, but twice during the birth of her daughter Simone. The antidote to this reckoning with darkness was surrender. Not giving up, but giving over. In this extraordinary act of metamorphosis, an experience that unites birthing bodies around the world, we enter the wilderness.During our matrescence, the physical, psychological, and spiritual changes that define the crossing into motherhood, we embrace the space between us. A precarious symbiotic existence takes over as we trade one labour for another. We are at once, lost and found. The exact length of matrescence is individual, recurs with every child, and can last a lifetime. Despite the everywhereness of the experience, limited visual documents exist in the public consciousness. Eclipse describes the incomparable life force demanded by early motherhood, the process of confronting our unknown, unknowns. Marked by a chaotic stillness, further complicated by the  Covid 19 pandemic, these photographs describe a practice of devotion. Everyday moments acquire a numinous power as our capacity for joy and wonder becomes even-more generative. There is so much to hold in this moment. In honouring our vulnerability, Cromwell creates a form of emotional solidarity, radically reimagining how we can be in community together.- Gemma Fletcher",https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20230123_203329_d304c9ea-3a6b-4e5e-b9e5-5f728c45d828.jpg?v=1702075369&width=4194,https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/RoseMarieCromwelltextblock17.jpg?v=1702075369&width=4252|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/RoseMarieCromwelltextblock18.jpg?v=1702075369&width=4252|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/RoseMarieCromwelltextblock19.jpg?v=1702075369&width=4252|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/RoseMarieCromwelltextblock20.jpg?v=1702075369&width=4252,available,https://www.tisbooks.pub/products/tis03-eclipse-rose-marie-cromwell

TIS03: The Folly,J Carrier,true,"also comes as part of a 12 book box set, TIS03
Every day Penelope, Julien and I would descend the steep slopes from our neighborhood into Washington DC’s Glover-Archbold National Park – an oasis of old growth forest that finds itself slowly being choked by poison ivy and other invasives (a category in which, during this period, we might have included ourselves) – to walk the shallow stream that runs in the valley. Under the unconcerned gaze of grazing deer, we searched for tadpoles and tulip poplar flowers, swords and gloop – we even once found a bat, near death, and were startled when it flung itself into the air, past our looming faces, latching onto a tree some 30 feet above us.
Forced off the trails by the rules of social distancing we explored every ravine and ridgetop, to the soundtrack of the Pileated Woodpecker, discovering secret hideouts and long-forgotten ruins. As the reality of the pandemic slowly built and its ravages were yet to fully reveal themselves, we turned our attention instead to the minute changes of the days – the first buds, and then first flowers, the trees damaged in the first summer storm. As the season slowly shifted, our relationship to this place changed; we became connected to it, and the kids wore it like an old pair of boots. A land within and outside reality, it was ours, and we came to call it The Folly.
The Folly Brook was the stream in our “night-night” book The Little Grey Men from which, every evening before bed, I would read to the kids, tired from their woodland wanders, of the adventures of Cloudberry, Dodder and Squirrel. The book begins “The wonder of the world, the beauty and the power, the shapes of things, their colours, lights and shades; these I saw. Look ye also, while life lasts.” I was struck by this clear description of the photographer’s task and invocation to the power of seeing, by the challenge to look – while life lasts. 
The pandemic has revealed more clearly the impermanence of life, a reality always pressing is now more present than ever; paradoxically, we have been given more time to look, and potentially, less time to last. These are a few images of looking and seeing and lasting.",https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/files/20230123_203213_10a627dc-27dd-4ef8-9517-221ab3509510.jpg?v=1702075534&width=4194,https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/JCarriertextblock2.jpg?v=1702075534&width=4252|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/JCarriertextblock10.jpg?v=1702075534&width=4252|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/JCarriertextblock15.jpg?v=1702075534&width=4252|https://www.tisbooks.pub/cdn/shop/products/JCarriertextblock16.jpg?v=1702075534&width=4252,available,https://www.tisbooks.pub/products/tis03-the-folly-j-carrier

TIS03: Shelter,Sasha Arutyunova,true,"also comes as part of a 12 book box set, TIS03
Common among the indoor and outdoor views that comprise Sasha Arutyunova’s Shelter (2021) is the sense that they reflect a much more tender landscape within. These images were born from the disorientation, longing, and anxiety of a devastating year. But how to make pictures of a feeling? Perhaps it’s not possible, except to look around and try to dance around the grief. They reflect Rebecca Solnit’s sense that the mind is a landscape of its own, and that walking is “one way to traverse it.”
Taken across Brooklyn and in upstate New York, Shelter includes still lifes of sorts, outdoor scenes, and photographs of people that are not quite portraits. While the faces of adults are mostly obscured, it is the children who embody a sense of hope and comfort in their more innocent contemplation. Elsewhere, the shadowed slope of a shoulder, the sturdy curve of thick tree branches, sharp reflections of sunlight, and delicate sprigs of leaves tell stories of a slow reacquaintance with one’s own outer and inner geographies. How to shelter from the storm, when the storm is also within? One way, these photographs suggest, is to fully engage with the overwhelming sublime, to locate awe and beauty even when they are inextricable from fear.

***
For TIS03 - the third installment of the TIS multi-artist series - we’ve taken advantage of this eventful time in history to expand beyond the TIS collective and include new friends and fresh outlooks.
Social and political upheaval, a tumultuous election, and a crippling pandemic that’s forced the majority of the world to shelter in place: all of this has left many artists in various states of making. After months of self-isolation some photographers began to slowly venture out again, ready to see and feel this new world of ours photographically. Others took advantage of the extra hours spent at home to photograph family or to travel in time via sifting through archives; many explored new ways to work without regular access to their studio or darkroom.
Taken together, the books in TIS03 exhibit an irrepressible artistic ingenuity born of necessity. Individually, they are cohesive worlds created as provisional response to chaos and confusion.
TIS03 is twelve books by twelve artists, sold both as a box set and as individual titles.
