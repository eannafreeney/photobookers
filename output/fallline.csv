AN IMPOSSIBLY NORMAL LIFE;Matthew Finley;TRUE;"Four years ago, my mother offhandedly mentioned that I had an uncle who may have been gay, but he died soon after I was born. Hearing this thirty years after I had struggled to come out to my disapproving family sent my mind spinning. The thought of a family member going through some of the same things I did inspired me to create this story. At first, I pondered how to photograph his story but the idea of costuming a sitter or myself as my uncle felt wrong. The more I thought about it, the honesty and authenticity of vernacular photography fit with what I wanted to create. So, I started purchasing and collecting images from eBay. I cast an ‘average dark-haired guy’ (that may look a little like me) as my Uncle Ken and searched for him in photos from around the world with an eye to how they might serve my narrative. I named him Ken, after my college drama teacher, one of the first openly ‘out’ people I had ever known and who had helped me realize my truth about being gay. The story of Uncle Ken's life was inspired by what I could find. For instance, there were so many great photos of men being affectionate in the services that I had to create a period of his life in the Navy. As my collection grew to over 100 images, I organized the photos chronologically to keep track of the arc of his life. This inspired the idea of actually creating Uncle Ken’s vintage photo album, as if he had made it. Eventually, this inspired me to publish it as a book. To round out the story, I have included three letters of correspondence about his first heartbreak, a note to his family while feeling lonely in the Navy, and one from Grant, his fiancé, the night before their wedding. While this work is fictional, it speaks to the lack of positive queer stories from our past. There are few, positive ""lineage stories"" to feel a part of because so much in our past had to be hidden. Same sex and gender non-conforming lives have often been erased from history. This work steps into that space. Instead of returning to the hiding or shame of most pre-1970’s queer stories (a reality of how our world was, and in some cases, still is), I have created an alternate history where fluidity in gender and sexuality is the societal norm. Re-contextualized found photographs create a new life for my Uncle Ken, one full of acceptance, friends, and love, and show anyone struggling with identity today the joy of what could have been and can still be.";https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/An_Impossibly_Normal_Life.jpg?v=1770404120&width=1946;https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/18_c.png?v=1770404120&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Front_Back_Finley.jpg?v=1770404120&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Open_Book_Mockup_1.jpg?v=1770404120&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Open_Book_Mockup_2.jpg?v=1770404120&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Open_Book_Mockup_3.jpg?v=1770404120&width=1946;available;https://falllinepress.com/products/an-impossibly-normal-life-by-matthew-finley
AGAINST THE GRAIN;Mark Maio;TRUE;"Photographer Mark Maio devoted more than three decades to create the images that document the last years of a tough-minded gang of Great Lakes union men that celled themselves Scoopers. They operated in groups of eighteen, referred to as gangs, and their primary responsibility was to unload large grain-hauling vessels from the nineteenth century and into the twenty-first. The first of the scoopers touched the edge of American history, for many were the very same Irish immigrants who dug the Erie Canal (1817-25), some as indentured servants.Anthony Bannon, a Royal Photographic Society medalist in history and criticism, wrote an accompanying essay in six chapters, a story about the 107 photographs drawn out of the thousands that Maio exposed during decades the artist committed to making a book he called Against the Grain. His book is about the grain shovelers and their union, among the first on the Lakes, the Grain Shovelers Union 109. The book begins, however, with grain farmers in Kansas.Maio’s purpose was to collect the elements necessary to record a story crucial to the unification of a united states called America, a brand new economic powerhouse in the world. “The Breadbasket harbor of Buffalo”, said the world, pointing to the entry way to the Erie Canal and thereby connection to the Atlantic Ocean. “The Bread Breadbasket territory,” the world added, seeing the harvest of grain in Kansas, becoming a state of the union in 1861, the 34th, and by the Missouri Compromise, free.Dr. Bannon identified the historic transactions that fueled the nation’s economy, both saloons and breakfast tables - moving grain as a commodity from farm to distant market - a profoundly effective commerce along a Great Grain Route, the equal of the international pathways for profit in previous centuries, among them those developed for the silk, salt, and tea markets.Bannon was the longest serving director of George Eastman House, the International Museum of Photography and Film in Rochester NY, an important city on the Erie Canal, and before that he was the second director of the largest artist’s archive, the Burchfield Penney Art Center in Buffalo, NY, dedicated to the American watercolorist Charles E. Burchfield, whose work often depicts activities in the Buffalo harbor, dominated by the scoopers. When the scoopers went on strike in 1899, they halted commerce on the Lakes. But they called themselves “scoopers” in large part because their work was a remarkably unique, a signature pattern of movement, thus a choreography Maio’s photographs detail as artful, dangerous, and singular, a kind of shoveling deep in the holds of schooners and lake steamers. “The story line of the scoopers traces an epic’s rise, heroes developed from unexpected origins, gaining stature through hard work, family values, and civic loyalty,” Bannon wrote. “Some scoopers had dug the Ere Canal (1817-1825), or were the descendants of the diggers, and some had dug clear to the Buffalo harbor, terminus of the Canal…” Some, Bannon continued, were willing to trade their freedom to escape famine in Ireland in hopes of opportunity in a new country, hard won. Those who survived to the canal’s end, just 12 years after Buffalo had been burned to the ground in the War of 1812, would live to see their children achieve solvency, even leadership at the Niagara Frontier. Maio’s photographs interpret the powerful dignity of labor and the strength of community that such labor created – both at the work’s origin in the fields of the harvested crop and during its passage to distribution, shoveled to its industry in mills and thus to table. “Maio’s photographs in Against the Grain are like the overture in musical theater anticipating several voices, structures, and tempi…And then there were the men, laborers, the scoopers, working simply at first with shovels and brooms, pitching and sweeping the grain,” Bannon wrote. “From the first, this was choreographed, each man knowing the moves of the next, keeping the flow, staying out of the way, making it work. And eventually, the ships became bigger and deeper, commanding blocks ad tackle and winches and ropes and pullies and giants shovels that moved the grain…”Maio’s coverage of the Grain Route began with the Joel Nelson family, descendants of Swedish immigrants, who were early settlers in Marquette, a city of 500 in the middle of the state that is in the middle of the United States, a region celebrated as this nation’s home on the range, where grain fields stretch to the horizon and are harvested in a dance between massive combines followed by bin trucks that transfer the grain for shipment from Duluth on Lake Superior through to Buffalo’s Scoopers, who off-load on Lake Erie at the beginning of the Erie Canal and a major railroad hub to eventual destinations in both domestic and European ports.The book’s design by Dolores Lusitana follows this weave of pictures and word, mediated by Maio’s description of the scoopers’ remarkable handling, rhythms not unfamiliar to Lusitana, who works with other celebrated stage and image artists, notably the singer/songwriter Paul Simon, on whose staff she served for more than 30 years, orchestrating the look and logistics of concerts, tours, and publications. The best of any photographs by anyone, said Brooks Jensen, “go beyond visual excellence by invoking our other senses.” Jensen is the founding editor and publisher of Lenswork magazine, a leading journal of photography since 1993. Writing in the foreword of Against the Grain, he continued: “Maio’s images are visually compelling as well as seducing us into an aural imagination…There is within each image a depth of experience that should not be missed.” The founder of the renowned media studies department at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Dr Richard Blau, formerly an American studies professor in Buffalo, reviewed Against the Grain. He considered the book “a small classic of American Studies.”


About Maio’s photographs, he wrote: “You can look at them for a very long time, sinking into their silence…there.” About the story: “Bannon provides the context, ranging across time, from pre-history to the present, focusing on Maio’s work through a multiple of lenses.” About the book’s writing and photography: “(James) Agee and (Walker) Evans come to mind.”Mark Maio: Against the Grain is published by Fall Line Press, Atlanta and New York, and is personally edited by Fall Line’s founder, Bill Boling, with Harry Wyman, Fall Line’s managing editor. Fall Line is an independent, international fine art press, focused on photography, particularly with artists from its region, since 2007. Maio is based in Atlanta, though often works as an artist and workshop instructor from the Isle of Skye, Scotland, and globally as an ophthalmic inventor, employing lens technology to enhance vision and detect disease.";https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Against_the_Grain.jpg?v=1764032355&width=1946;https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/08_Maio_Wall_Streetcopy.jpg?v=1764032355&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/3241_011_11A.jpg?v=1764032355&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/22_Maio_Wheat_Field_Marquette_KS.jpg?v=1764032355&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/57_Maio_Abandoned_Grain_Elevator.jpg?v=1764032355&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/09_Maio_Scooping_The_Hold.jpg?v=1764032355&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/10_Maio_The_Short_Quarter.jpg?v=1764032355&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/60_Maio_Have_You_Seen_Their_Facescopy.jpg?v=1764032355&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/29_Maio_Hold_Being_Filled.jpg?v=1764032355&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/32_Maio_Quarter_Note.jpg?v=1764032355&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/01_Maio_Street_Hockeycopy.jpg?v=1764032355&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/03_Maio_Macho_Mencopy.jpg?v=1764032355&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/04_Maio_Coming_Home_From_Schoolcopy.jpg?v=1764032355&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/BoyonBridge.jpg?v=1764032355&width=1946;available;https://falllinepress.com/products/against-the-grain-by-mark-maio
THIRTY-ONE DAYS;Christopher Lowell;TRUE;"During the final month in and around his childhood home, Christopher Lowell photographs a distinct portrait of the American South; a landscape as true as it is mythical. In Lowell’s interpretation, singular moments are made infinite. Bodies leap off roofs and fall from trees, suspended in permanent flight. The smoke from a cigarette and the sparks from a firecracker burn forever. In other pictures, the momentum of an action outpaces the shutter itself, encouraging the viewer to process the image the way one does a memory; coloring in details with emotions instead of information. The intentional absence of contextual clues frees the black & white imagery from any particular moment in time. There’s no evidence of technology, no hints from a subject’s clothes (in fact, there’s very little clothing at all). The result is an Edenic collection of photographs: simultaneously fleeting and everlasting, tactile and ethereal, grounded in reality yet floating above it. Communicated through 68 beautifully rendered, spot-varnished, duotone plates, Thirty-One Days invites us to experience “a single month for most, but a lifetime for those of us who are butterflies.”";https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/31_Days_d24dab6c-86ba-439c-8e9f-1d02f7fa30f2.jpg?v=1760108605&width=1946;https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Screenshot_2025-10-10_at_10.54.40_AM.png?v=1760108605&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/31days_bookdesign_FULL_FINAL2_Page_04.jpg?v=1760108605&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/31days_bookdesign_FULL_FINAL2_Page_06.jpg?v=1760108605&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/31days_bookdesign_FULL_FINAL2_Page_10.jpg?v=1760108605&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/31days_bookdesign_FULL_FINAL2_Page_13.jpg?v=1760108605&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/31days_bookdesign_FULL_FINAL2_Page_19.jpg?v=1760108605&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/31days_bookdesign_FULL_FINAL2_Page_20.jpg?v=1760108605&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/31days_bookdesign_FULL_FINAL2_Page_24.jpg?v=1760108605&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/31days_bookdesign_FULL_FINAL2_Page_35.jpg?v=1760108605&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/31days_bookdesign_FULL_FINAL2_Page_69.jpg?v=1760108605&width=1946;available;https://falllinepress.com/products/31-days-by-chris-lowell

COVID DIARY;Beth Galton;TRUE;COVID Diary is one photographer’s tale of processing the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of her camera. This unique book, one part diary and one part art exhibit allows a glimpse into Beth Galton’s life, thoughts, and art process as New York City weathered the storm of the global pandemic.While the news was everywhere and overwhelming at times, Beth found both comfort and heartbreak in it. Walking away from her well-honed skills as a commercial photographer, she began a process of creating images that would speak to her anxiety, to the uncertainty of the time, and to the trajectory of how this crisis was handled. Compelled to find the humanity in the myriad charts and graphs that reported cases, deaths, and recoveries, Beth reached for symbols of life to balance the data. Botanical matter is scattered through the photographs, metaphorically and hopefully interwoven with jarring data, and ephemera from this period.;https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Covid_89f32cde-f511-4c2a-a26f-68dfbcf1b278.jpg?v=1751221492&width=1946;https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/10_Capture_One_Catalog0024.jpg?v=1751221492&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/03_April_8_2020.jpg?v=1751221492&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/11_201009_Covid_Maps_80552.jpg?v=1751221492&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/20_210104_Covidmaps_11_vaccine1537.jpg?v=1751221484&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/39_210817_backgrd_for_covid_diaries32164.jpg?v=1751221484&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/21_210104_Covidmaps_11_vaccine1639.jpg?v=1751221484&width=1946;available;https://falllinepress.com/products/covid-diary-by-beth-galton

INFINITE BONHEUR;Brittainy Lauback;TRUE;The work in this book is like that strange moment when you are crying and everything feels off and wrong and all of the sudden you find yourself laughing uncontrollably for no reason. Or when you laugh at inappropriate times like my Auntie and I did at my Grandma Belle’s funeral. We knew it was wrong but any chance at getting it together seemed to make us laugh harder. My photography attempts to mimic that in-between space between laughter and crying or comedy and tragedy. The moment where your body is exhausted by grief and gives way to laughter. I do this by having a wide subject range that is photographed in different kinds of ways. I like to shoot on the street and find subjects. I take my camera everywhere with me so I can photograph friends and family, and I like to set up encounters with strangers. I sometimes shoot a particular theme, like “women who own snakes” or “men who want to meet in hotel rooms”. These varying methods allow my sense of voyeurism, humor, and my fear of death to emerge regardless of the subject matter.

OCEAN GLEANING;Pam Longobardi;TRUE;Ocean Gleaning proposes a collaboration between art, science, activism and like-minded groups that begins with the assumption that the ocean is a conscious entity that, in many different ways, from rising levels and temperatures to declining fish stocks to coral bleaching and finally to the deformed material plastic objects that float the world round, is attempting to communicate its declining state of being. Pam Longobardi has channeled her lifelong love of the ocean into an artistic practice that transforms the mountains of plastic debris that wash up on beaches around the world. For more than 15 years, Longobardi has utilized found ocean plastics as her primary source material, arranging hundreds of plastic pieces into wall-mounted artworks or floor-based sculptures. Working collaboratively with communities around the globe, Longobardi has cleaned beaches from Hawaii to Greece to Panama, and dozens of locations in between, removing tens of thousands of pounds of plastic from the environment and converting them into thought-provoking works of art that shed an unflinching light on the effects of global consumption on the natural world.;https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Ocean.jpg?v=1751201281&width=1946;https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Screenshot_2025-06-30_at_7.30.00_AM.png?v=1751283062&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/products/Ocean-02.jpg?v=1751283062&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/products/Ocean-06.jpg?v=1751283062&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/products/Ocean-08.jpg?v=1751283062&width=1946;available;https://falllinepress.com/products/ocean-gleaning

For more than 30 years, David Ricci has turned his camera on the everyday world with a curiosity that is driven by finding those places, views, and situations that bring the edge of chaos into alignment with the edge of aesthetic brilliance and transcendent beauty, seeking and finding a different and enlightening visual conversation with our material culture.

INK;Tanya Marcuse;FALSE;Ink showcases an unusual body of work by Tanya Marcuse which came about serendipitously after her young son insisted on trying nocturnal squid fishing one summer in Maine. Unlike the majority of Marcuse’s large-scale, elaborate works, these images were made with an iPhone camera, a more spontaneous and versatile tool. Marcuse’s uncanny images, in which the bodies of squid spread acrobatically across newspaper headlines, fashion advertisements, and marriage announcements, echo the broadside's sense of moral warning and impending apocalypse. As the squid ink obscures the printer’s ink, the photographs explore the materiality of the newspaper and the dynamic interplay between its sense of fact and order and the abstract, primordial chaos of the tangled tentacles. Both in their physical presence and the inky marks they leave behind, the bodies of the squid both obscure and transform the apparently objective narratives of the newspaper.;https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Ink_f2cb39fb-5429-4184-b55b-7531a674fc72.jpg?v=1751201284&width=1946;https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Screenshot_2025-06-30_at_7.41.44_AM.png?v=1751283794&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Screenshot_2025-06-30_at_7.42.01_AM.png?v=1751283794&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Screenshot_2025-06-30_at_7.42.25_AM.png?v=1751283795&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Screenshot_2025-06-30_at_7.42.40_AM.png?v=1751283795&width=1946;available;https://falllinepress.com/products/ink
BLACK DIAMONDS;Rich-Joseph Facun;TRUE;"Black Diamonds is a personal endeavor to connect with the Appalachian region Facun now calls home. As a person of color, he defines his community based on personal experience diverging from the stereotypes of race, religion, gender, and politics that are often attached to the region by outsiders. His images hint at life as it once was, sharing the hyperrealism of what it is today and the uncertainty of what it is to become in the coal mining boomtowns of bygone days. Life in Appalachia is fraught with mystery and mischaracterization. Yet, in all his interactions, the simple needs of day-to-day survival loom larger than the abstract issues of politics.

Essick photographed the forest for two years with the goal to produce a personal vision of this natural ecosystem that can coexist with a large metropolitan city.

THE BULLY PULPIT;Haley Morris-Cafiero;TRUE;"Haley Morris-Cafiero investigates the social phenomenon of cyberbullying by utilizing self-portraiture against those who’ve attempted to bully her.
After her series Wait Watchers went viral, Haley Morris-Cafiero received numerous hateful comments on the internet. The Bully Pulpit is her response to those comments. An inspired Morris-Cafiero realized that she could parody the bullies by creating images and publishing those images on the internet —the same vehicle used for the attacks. Photographing herself costumed like the people who’ve attempted to bully her, she recreated their images found via public profiles by using wigs, clothing, and simple prosthetics and overlaid those images with transcripts of the bullying comments. The result is The Bully Pulpit, a project that pushes the boundaries of self-portraiture and raises questions about the social sphere of the internet.";https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Bully.jpg?v=1751201276&width=1946;https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/SpeedoMan_51e09267-70dc-403b-8656-066ffbf68cfa.jpg?v=1751284254&width=1946;available;https://falllinepress.com/products/the-bully-pulpit

CARL MARTIN;Carl Martin;TRUE;How do we present ourselves to the world and how is that presentation received–what does it mean? Ultimately, this is not a document that is specific to a place or time, it is more akin to a universal canvassing and inventory of humanity in the ordinary.

TRUE PLACES;Jack Carnell;TRUE;"True Places is a welcomed pause in our fast-paced experiences of the modern world. It encourages us to slow down and appreciate the richness of our surroundings, especially in the seemingly mundane.
Jack Carnell has an unique eye for the textures, intricacies and quirks that make up small town and suburban living in the United States. As Wendy Brenner writes, “Jack Carnell’s images are so intimate, so intensely expressive and emotional, that a viewer might fail to notice the absence of people. Here, instead, are the tools we use to orient ourselves and our days, the signs, arrows, scales, directions, filing cabinets and drawers, the wires connecting everything to everything. How fanatically we interact with our small territories. How busy we are, running our tiny worlds, before we disappear altogether.”

ME. HERE NOW;Corinne Vionnet;TRUE;The advent of smartphones has conditioned new reflexes and created a new, unsettling gestural vocabulary that evokes a near-mystical posture. A direct reference to the work of Abraham Moles on the philosophy of centrality, ME. Here Now captures the specific moment when tourists take, with their smartphones, near-identical pictures of what is paradoxically a unique experience for them. Beyond the ritual of holiday pictures, these images—often instantly shared—create a new language, as with the certificate of presences by Roland Barthes or with the photograph-trophies by Susan Sontag. Vionnet's portraits of these nameless individuals, half-concealed behind smartphone screens, also underscore the omnipresence of surveillance in public areas and remind us that all of our wanderings may be photographed.;https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Me_755f53cf-bfaa-4dd9-a660-7f171635b7af.jpg?v=1751204203&width=1946;https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Screenshot_2025-03-31_at_4.36.15_PM.png?v=1751204203&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Me_here_now_book_2.png?v=1751291549&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Me_here_now_1.png?v=1751291549&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Me_here_now_book_1.png?v=1751291549&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Me_here_now_2.png?v=1751291547&width=1946;available;https://falllinepress.com/products/me-here-now
SWEETHEART ROLLER SKATING RINK;Bill Yates;TRUE;Sweetheart Roller Skating Rink is a royal road to that special time in 1972-1973—when the love generation in America was at its height. The U.S. was reeling from years of war and turbulent social change and progress, but the early 70s was still a time of innocence and exploration. Sweetheart shows us the joyful vigor, fashion, and play of that young crowd searching for fun, escape, and identity in a roller rink on the outskirts of Tampa, Florida and reveals, in a candid and clear-eyed way, a time that you only thought you knew. The photographic gaze of the twenty-five-year-old Yates is exceptional. Freshly returned from his tour of military service, Yates was still young enough to understand and relate to this crowd but no longer part of their world. There is a raw power of deep seeing here. His camera and stance toward his subjects assumes nothing. And therefore it reveals everything.;https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Sweetheart_a785f4fe-5df6-42f1-af9d-d189b0e6c134.jpg?v=1751201288&width=1946;https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Sweetheart_3.png?v=1751291794&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Sweetheart_4.png?v=1751291794&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Sweetheart_2.png?v=1751291794&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Sweetheart_1.png?v=1751291794&width=1946;available;https://falllinepress.com/products/sweetheart-roller-skating-rink

Fusing the style and the physical proximity of a photojournalist with the conceptual distance and healthy skepticism of an artist, his pictures speak to a set of themes that resonate deeply with the American experience over the past half century, revealing the simultaneously familiar and curious rituals of American life.;https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/America.jpg?v=1751204594&width=1946;https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/files/Screenshot_2025-03-31_at_4.35.18_PM.png?v=1751204594&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/products/America101-3.jpg?v=1751204594&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/products/America101-4.jpg?v=1751204594&width=1946|https://falllinepress.com/cdn/shop/products/America101-5.jpg?v=1751204594&width=1946;available;https://falllinepress.com/products/america-101
