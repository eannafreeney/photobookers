An Extremely Un-Get-Atable Place,Craig Easton,true,"‘It’s an extremely un-get-atable place, but it’s a nice house and I think I can make it quite comfortable with a little trouble.’—George Orwell
An Extremely Un-get-atable Place is a lyrical reimagining of the time that writer George Orwell lived at Barnhill, a remote farmhouse on the Isle of Jura in Scotland. It was here that Orwell wrote his landmark book Nineteen Eighty-Four—a dire warning of the dangers of totalitarianism and political despotism. Photographer Craig Easton was invited to stay at Barnhill—largely unchanged since Orwell’s time—where he made a series of landscape and still life images. In Easton’s new book, these photographs are presented alongside extracts from Orwell’s letters and diaries written on the island.","Published December 2025

Flowers for Bea,Brendan Barry,true,"Flowers for Bea is a book of still life photographs of wildflowers collected close to artist Brendan Barry’s home in Devon. The images were created in a camera obscura—a room sized camera, operated from the inside—using two distinct analogue processes. The creation of each photograph involved a painstaking process of alchemy and patience with a successful exposure sometimes taking up to 8 hours. 
A video showing Barry’s process can be viewed here.","Published December 2025
