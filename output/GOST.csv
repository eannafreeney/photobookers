An Extremely Un-Get-Atable Place,Craig Easton,true,"‘It’s an extremely un-get-atable place, but it’s a nice house and I think I can make it quite comfortable with a little trouble.’—George Orwell
An Extremely Un-get-atable Place is a lyrical reimagining of the time that writer George Orwell lived at Barnhill, a remote farmhouse on the Isle of Jura in Scotland. It was here that Orwell wrote his landmark book Nineteen Eighty-Four—a dire warning of the dangers of totalitarianism and political despotism. Photographer Craig Easton was invited to stay at Barnhill—largely unchanged since Orwell’s time—where he made a series of landscape and still life images. In Easton’s new book, these photographs are presented alongside extracts from Orwell’s letters and diaries written on the island.

Flowers for Bea,Brendan Barry,true,"Flowers for Bea is a book of still life photographs of wildflowers collected close to artist Brendan Barry’s home in Devon. The images were created in a camera obscura—a room sized camera, operated from the inside—using two distinct analogue processes. The creation of each photograph involved a painstaking process of alchemy and patience with a successful exposure sometimes taking up to 8 hours. 
A video showing Barry’s process can be viewed here.

The Fumes of Mars,Katerina Angelopoulou,true,"‘A large wildfire has a very distinctive sound. No one can tell you unless they have been in one. It is a sound that can haunt you…’ One of the deadliest wildfires ever recorded took place on 23 July 2018 just 30km from the historical centre of Athens in Greece. Artist Katerina Angelopoulou survived the fire and her forthcoming book The Fumes of Mars combines her photographs with personal testimonies from other survivors, timelines, maps and reports. With these materials Angelopoulou attempts to weave together a collective narrative of the events to better understand the violent disconnect between her own experience and the ‘official’ account of the disaster in which facts were concealed and victims held culpable.

As Donovan began to photograph the city and its residents—driven to explore the proximity of extreme wealth and poverty— he became increasingly aware of the realities of environmental classism and ecological injustices in the city.

Only a few of the images were printed at the time and the vast majority remained unseen, except as negatives, until now.

Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Imperfections,Mandy Barker,false,"‘In 2012, I found a piece of material in a rock pool that changed my life. Mistaking this moving piece of cloth for seaweed, started the recovery of synthetic clothing from around the coastline of Britain for the next ten years.’ Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Imperfections is a typology of discarded clothing fragments found around the coast of the UK. A homage to the work of pioneering botanist and photographer Anna Atkins (1799-1871)—the unique cyanotype images in the book mimic different species of marine algae found in waters around Great Britain. Through the creation of this work, photographic artist Mandy Barker hopes to raise awareness of fast fashion, synthetic clothes, and the harmful effect of microfibres in the oceans.

The Grind,Steve Madden,false,"The photographs in The Grind by Steve Madden show the strange beauty of anonymous commuters behind the misty windows of the London bus network.
The images were all made during the evening peak rush hour over the course of three winters. They capture a small snapshot of the 5 million bus journeys made in the capital city every day. Madden would spend the mornings on the radio for the BBC and then journey into Central London whenever it rained or if it was freezing cold late in the day. The bad weather would lead to condensation on the bus windows—familiar to many Londoners—and create the abstract scenes Madden wished to photograph.

The Makeshift City by Joshua Dudley Greer shows a contemporary Atlanta in a state of flux—both a unique city with a specific history and culture, and a generic American metropolis struggling to forge its identity.

Spina Americana,Richard Sharum,false,"Driven by both national and personal anxiety about the current divisions in the US, photographer Richard Sharum embarked on a journey through the central ‘spine’ of America. He was in search of the unifying elements of contemporary American ‘national character’. Focusing on a 100 mile-wide corridor down the geographic centre of the US encompassing parts of the Dakotas, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas—an area often dismissed as ‘flyover’ country—Sharum spoke to more than 4000 people and took over 14000 photographs. His aim was to see if this region could hold the key to a better understanding of who America still is as a country and what remains of the collective hope of a unified nation.

Say Less,Greg Gulbransen,false,"Over the course of three years, Greg Gulbransen photographed Malik, a set leader of the violent street gang, the Crips. Malik was shot and paralysed in 2018 by the bullet from a rival gang, and as a result his world now centres around his small Bronx apartment in New York, where he is cared for by his family and fellow gang members.
Gulbransen, a practicing doctor, had been photographing in the Bronx during his spare time and had got to know some of the local kids. He began to notice a lot of young men in wheelchairs with spinal injuries and was professionally curious. He was told they had all been shot. He wanted to speak to someone in a wheelchair and was introduced to Malik through a fellow Crip.

Chernobyl,Pierpaolo Mittica,false,"Chernobyl by photographer Pierpaolo Mittica is a document of the communities who inhabit and pass through the exclusion zone—an area covering approximately 2600 km2 around the site of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster of 1986. Mittica first journeyed to Chernobyl in 2002, drawn like many to photograph the impact of the worst technological catastrophe of the modern era. He returned many times and rather than focusing on the ruins and relics, sought to tell the stories of those he encountered in this unique place.

Fugue,Lydia Goldblatt,false,"Fugue by Lydia Goldblatt is a body of work about love and grief, mothering and losing a mother, intimacy and distance, told through photographs and writing. Centring on the domestic space and made over the course of four years, it tells a story that is neither apologetic nor idealised.
When Goldblatt became a mother she found herself unable to make pictures. However, after her own mother died, she began to photograph again, both at home and in the city around her.
‘I wanted to be honest about what I was struggling with, about the feelings of claustrophobia and rage, as much as intimacy and love. These are feelings so often hidden by mothers, so often silenced as unacceptable.’
An exhibition of photographs from Fugue will be on display at Robert Morat Galerie this autumn - Opening night 25th October.

The Group For Mutual Improvement,Jordan Baumgarten,false,"The black and white photographs in The Group For Mutual Improvement were taken in a vacant lot behind photographer Jordan Baumgarten’s home in Philadelphia. Over a period of 10 years, Baumgarten and his neighbours spent much of their time together in this lot. His book is a document of these gatherings.
The title is drawn from the Junto, also known as the Leather Apron Club— a diverse group of individuals Benjamin Franklin brought together in colonial era Philadelphia for the purpose of mutual improvement. They would gather in a tavern to debate questions of morals, politics, current events, philosophy, and local businesses. Baumgarten’s group was much less formal but the discussions no less vital.

Smith was curious about the athlete who was starting to become influential in the world of boxing. Fortuitously, he was in gym when the doors opened and, much to everyone's surprise, in walked The Beatles.

My America,Diana Matar,false,"‘…what does it mean to live in a land where the people responsible for protecting its citizens can so often be involved in their deaths?’
 In the US, approximately 1000 people continue to die each year in encounters with police.  More than any other industrialised nation. My America is an archive of and memorial to victims of these encounters. The photographs, taken at locations where citizens were shot or tasered by law enforcement officers, create a quiet but chilling critique of the contemporary United States. The scale of the book­­­­­­­­­­ attests to the scale of the problem yet Matar asks us to remember these are individuals.

Nothing Personal - The Back Office of War,Nikita Teryoshin,false,"Every day on the news we are shown images of war and destruction. This coincides with global expenditure on arms increasing year after year. However, we are rarely afforded a glimpse behind the curtains of the global arms business. Photographer Nikita Teryoshin travelled to 16 arms fairs between 2016 and 2023 to investigate what happens before wars take place. His aim was to take photographs at exclusive so-called defence expositions— which are closed to the public—on every continent to highlight the global nature of the industry.

The year in which photographer Jillian Edelstein turned 40 she came across an image of her great aunt Minna, of whose existence she had been unaware. The photograph of Minna became the catalyst for a journey to unearth her family history and the discovery of an unknown branch of her family living in Ukraine.

A selection of his vast archive of photographs made over a period of 15 years will be published in We the Spirits. Collectively, his images dispel stereotypes of Carnival and illustrate the complex diversity of local customs united by universal themes.

Odesa,Yelena Yemchuk,false,"As a child growing up in Kyiv, Yelena Yemchuk was fascinated by the reputation of Odesa as a free place during Soviet times. The city seemed full of contradictions — 'acceptance but also danger. A place of jokes and characters, populated by outlaws and intellectuals.' She first visited Odesa in 2003 and returned in 2015 to begin to photograph the city and its inhabitants over a period of four years. This book is Yemchuk’s visual ode to the city.

The Truth is in the Soil,Ioanna Sakellaraki,false,"The Truth is in the Soil by Ioanna Sakellaraki is a 5-year exploration of grief as an elegy to her late father and the dying tradition of mourning in Greece. After her personal loss, Sakellaraki’s own grieving process became the lens through which she investigated collective mourning in Greek society, the intersection of ancestral rituals, private trauma and the passage of time. Further inspired by the last communities of mourners on the Mani Peninsula of Greece as the doyennes of a dying tradition, the work explores mortuary rituals as a way of humans adapting to death.

Bank Top,Craig Easton & Abdul Aziz Hafiz,false,"BANK TOP by photographer Craig Easton examines the representation and misrepresentation of northern communities. The work focuses on a small, tight-knit community in Blackburn, England, which has become synonymous with the use of words like segregation and integration – BBC’s Panorama describing it as ‘the most segregated town in Britain’.
Easton’s photographs, alongside texts by writer, poet and social researcher Abdul Aziz Hafiz, aim to confront stereotypes and question the dangerous over-simplification of the challenges facing such communities. They do so by presenting the contemporary experience of residents as an ‘alternative history telling’.

Sin Salida,Tariq Zaidi,false,"Sin Salida (No Way Out) by photographer Tariq Zaidi documents the impacts of the notorious Mara Salvatrucha gang (MS-13) and its rival Barrio 18 gang members on El Salvador. By depicting the gang members, police, prisons, murder sites, funerals, and the government’s war against the gangs, Zaidi illustrates the control the gangs have over the wider Salvadoran society, the violence through which they operate and the grief and loss resulting from the violence.

I Am Warning You,Rafał Milach,false,"I Am Warning You by Rafal Milach is a book-quadtych dedicated to three different border walls: American-Mexican (#13767), Hungarian-Serbian-Croatian (I Am Warning You) and the Berlin Wall (Death Strip). Collectively, alongside a collection of essays, they present an architectural survey dedicated to propaganda and control whilst also collecting experiences—the memories and scars—of the borderland communities. The quadtych represents various physical structures that are degrading from one book to another—from the heavily fortified American wall to the Hungarian electric fence to the traces and memory imprints of the Berlin Wall.

This new book, the halfway point for the series, continues the visual chronicle – but under very different circumstances than when he began.

Daleside,Cyprien Clément-Delmas & Lindokuhle Sobekwa,false,"French photographer Cyprien Clément-Delmas and South African photographer Lindokuhle Sobekwa have collaborated to create a portrait of Daleside, a small and isolated Afrikaner suburb south-east of Johannesburg. The two photographers met through the Of Soul and Joy programme, launched by Rubis Mécénat in Thokoza, and became friends. Their resulting images provide a counterpoint of aspirations and distress — looking beyond the deep-seated Black/white binary, they depict the poverty afflicting Black and white residents alike as forgotten members of society.

Hayal & Hakikat:  A Handbook of Forgiveness & A Handbook of Punishment,Cemre Yeşil Gönenli,false,"The photographs in this book depict the hands of prisoners from the early 20th century, drawn from the photograph albums of Abdul Hamid II, the 34th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Abdul Hamid II had been moved by pseudo-scientific information he read in a crime novel that “any criminal with a thumb joint longer than the index finger joint, is inclined to murder.” To this end, the photographs in this book show the subjects’ hands for the purpose of classification. The fate of the individual prisoners remains unknown as there is no record of the verdict of Abdul Hamid II after viewing the hands awaiting forgiveness.

Sackcloth and Ashes,Witold Krassowski,false,"Sackcloth and Ashes is the result of a lifetime of work by Polish photographer Witold Krassowski. Although he has photographed major historic and political events which have helped shape societies across the world, he has always been drawn to photographing ordinary lives  - his best-known images are the ones he took during the transformation of his native Poland following the end of communism in 1989. The disparate locations and subjects of Krassowski’s work are unified by his choice to focus on the lives of common citizens rather than the elite or political entities.

Freedom or Death,Gideon Mendel,false,"Thirty years ago, photographer Gideon Mendel left a box of negatives and transparencies in storage in a friend’s garage in Johannesburg. At some point the box was rained upon and the top layers damaged. The affected photographs were from Mendel’s documentation of the final years of apartheid when he had witnessed the nationwide township uprising and scenes of mobilization, conflict and tragedy. This act of happenstance led to Mendel revisiting and re-engaging with his archives, and the gradual creation of this book Freedom or Death.

SPUD,Brian Griffin,false,"SPUD, a new book by Brian Griffin, inspired by a residency in Béthune-Bruay in Northern France, marks the centenary of the end of World War I. With the coincidence of ‘SPUD’, the informal British word for potato also being slang for low ranking British soldiers in World War I, Griffin began to explore the relationship between the potatoes grown in the soil and the soldiers who were killed in the very same place, over 100 years ago.

The First March of Gentlemen,Rafał Milach,false,"In The First March of Gentlemen, Rafal Milach creates a fictitious narrative composed of authentic stories. He retells the historical childrens’ strike in Września in Poland from the early 20th Century, through collaged archive photographs from the 1950s and 1960. By blending these elements, he has created a new narrative, to be read as a playful metaphor for the political situation of the present. This project was created by the Deutsche Borse Prize shortlisted photographer on the Kolekcja Września residency programme in 2016.

Brisées,Helen Sear,false,"The monochrome, often pixelated images of woodlands in the book are sourced from the internet following a Google image search for the phrase ‘tree surgeon’. Each image features a placed orb which sometimes covers half of the picture surface. (…) The project began when Sear started to collect branches and twigs from Cuckoo Wood, close to her home in Wales. The title is a nod to the French Surrealist writer and ethnographer Michel Leirisâ’s 1966 work of the same name.

Pittsburgh 1950,Elliott Erwitt,false,"In 1950, 22-year-old Elliott Erwitt was commissioned by the legendary Roy Stryker to document Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as it emerged from a notoriously polluted industrial city into a cleaner, more modern metropolis. Shooting for Stryker’s newly organised Pittsburgh Photographic Library, Erwitt’s photographs captured the humanity and spirit of the people of the city against the angular industrial architecture. Drafted into the army in Germany just four months after arriving in Pittsburgh, Erwitt was forced to abandon the project, leaving his negatives behind. For decades, the negatives were held at the Pennsylvania Department of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, and as a result, a majority of the photographs in this book have neither been published nor exhibited before.

Spill,Daniel Beltrà,false,"Spill features aerial photographs of the Deepwater Horizon Gulf Oil Spill. Collectively, these images present a damaged sea with the abstract appearance of veined marble in deep blue, green, pink and rust. The human presence takes the form of tiny toy-like helicopters and ships, and an oil platform that, on first glance, seems to be a fantastical Chinese sea palace. Only the billowing smoke from a great fire signals the true destruction caused by the disaster. Captured from above the disaster takes on a monumental scale far removed from the human and natural drama on the ground.

During the autumn and winters of 2010 and 2011 Power documented over fifty Catholic Church services in Krakow. A lapsed Catholic, Power became fascinated with the huge numbers attending local churches whilst working in Poland. With the help of a local ‘fixer’ he gained access to a number of churches and permission to photograph from the ‘choir’ or ‘organista’ in Polish, high up at the back of the church.

Silent Witness (GER),Cornelia Suhan,false,"‘A war is not over when the weapons are silent.’  - Cornelia Suhan
In Silent Witness photographs of private houses and public buildings in which war crimes—specifically rapes of women of all ethnic groups living in Bosnia and Herzegovina—were committed during the Bosnian War (1992-1995) are combined with testimonies from the women who survived. Cornelia Suhan’s photographs of these buildings— the silent witnesses—allow the stories to be told without exposing those affected to the public again.
