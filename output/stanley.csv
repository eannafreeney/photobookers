Where the Light Came in;Judith Black;FALSE;"The most consequential moments are rarely dramatic. What stays with us, what makes us feel truly seen, is often small, domestic, and endlessly repeated. Judith Black’s photographs, made at home in the early 1980s of her four young children and their stepfather, remind us of this simple truth. 
In 1980, after a divorce, Judith moved her family to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and took a job at the darkroom at MIT. Their home wasn’t grand, but it was theirs, a place to begin again. Not long after settling in, they found a worn old armchair left on the side of the road and gave it a place by the window. It became a spot of rest and quiet theatre, a vantage point from which Judith watched her children grow, day by day, frame by frame. 
This new book gathers every photograph she made of that single chair. What begins as cast-off furniture becomes, through her attentive eye, a kind of threshold: a simple thing that holds a whole world. There is a truth here that is easy to overlook, that by staying close to the ordinary, by returning to the same corner of a room, we might learn to see more clearly. And that the measure of a life is so often found not in grand gestures, but in the worn fabric of a chair, the shifting light, the hush of children growing older under our watch.

Where the Light Came In has been carefully designed to feel like an object of devotion; the kind of object a parent might make at home. Each photograph has been silkscreened with a soft gloss varnish, echoing the sheen of prints lovingly pasted into an album. Handwritten notations run through the pages, intimate and unguarded. The book itself is coverless, its exposed binding sewn and held in place with quiet precision, a gesture of care and vulnerability.
""The chair, a curbside find on garbage day, was covered with a swath of dark brown corduroy to hide its tattered arms and worn cushions. It sat by the entryway door and caught brief moments of early morning light from the dusty living room bay window that looked over the alley separating our apartment from our neighbour."" - Judith Black";https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/rf.jpg?v=1762516675&width=1946;https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/JB2.jpg?v=1762516675&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/3456wsd.jpg?v=1762516675&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/etrs.jpg?v=1762516874&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/wergwww.jpg?v=1762516874&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/JB4.jpg?v=1762516874&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/wfegw.jpg?v=1762517018&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/wrgbw.jpg?v=1762517018&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/werthgw.jpg?v=1762517018&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/JB1.jpg?v=1762517018&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/jgf.jpg?v=1762517018&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/wrtsxss.jpg?v=1762516958&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/JB6.jpg?v=1762516958&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/wry.jpg?v=1762516958&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/11_7799fb19-0a7b-439e-b6a9-2f867dc4c6b7.jpg?v=1762516874&width=1946;sold-out;https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/products/where-the-light-came-in
L.A. Polaroids;Robby Müller;FALSE;"In the 1980s, the acclaimed Dutch cinematographer Robby Müller spent months at a time away from home, collaborating with renowned directors such as Alex Cox and Wim Wenders to create some of the decade’s most influential films such as Repo Man, Paris, Texas, Barfly and To Live and Die in L.A..
After long days on set, Müller stayed at the Kensington Motel in Santa Monica, a simple apartment hotel just behind Ocean Boulevard and steps from the beach. He liked its plain comforts: an ironing board folded into the wall, a coffee pot bubbling on the stove, Garfield the hotel cat who kept him company. It felt familiar, not just a place to pass through. 
He always carried his SX-70 Polaroid camera, making tender images when work paused, bringing what William Friedkin called “a foreigner’s eye” to America: noticing details others missed, avoiding clichés, always returning to light and colour as his true subjects. In these Polaroids, Müller frames a Los Angeles that no longer exists: small rooms, edges of the beach, street corners, a city built for cars seen by a cinematographer who preferred to walk. They reveal a man far from home, looking for stillness and light in the spaces in between.
Edited and with an introduction by Andrea Müller-Schirmer; designed by Linda van Deursen and expertly printed in Italy and bound as a uniquely flexible chopped linen soft-back, silk screened in a sun-kissed orange, it carries the warmth of Müller’s Los Angeles. Alongside Müller’s images are texts from his collaborators, including directors Alex Cox and Wim Wenders, and actor Willem Dafoe.
""What impressed me was he would see what no one saw – the origin, the presence, the vibration, the possibility of what was already there..."" - Willem Dafoe

The Ramble, NYC 1969;Arthur Tress;FALSE;"In 1969, Arthur Tress began taking his camera with him on walks through the Ramble, an overgrown corner of Central Park that had become New York’s best-known outdoor meeting place for queer men. Designed as a picturesque woodland in the nineteenth century, by the late 1960s it had grown wild, a hidden, half-forgotten place of chance encounters in the middle of the city.
For a little over a year, Tress returned again and again, recording the everyday choreography of cruising and creating what is now recognised as the earliest known photographic record of outdoor cruising in a natural setting.
His images show the flow of men through the Ramble, some caught from a distance, others posed or gently staged in small scenes. He saw these photographs not just as documentation but as a kind of queer still life, part allegory, part dream.
Long unseen, The Ramble is now considered a vital piece of New York’s queer history, part ethnography, part fantasy. More than fifty years later, it stands alongside a new generation of queer landscape projects that share its quiet focus on how bodies, longing, and hidden places shape each other.
Containing an essay by art historian Jackson Davidow, The Ramble is the first publication of this remarkable archive: an early portrait of a hidden world, a city’s wild corner, and an artist searching for himself among the trees.";https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/cover.jpg?v=1758793781&width=1946;https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/7_eb657f00-a745-43a9-8ba4-ce95a8e0799c.jpg?v=1758793781&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/2223.jpg?v=1758793781&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/55_f5a1c71b-a2a1-45b9-a836-511c8e738ef4.jpg?v=1758793781&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/66_abf0c141-2032-4cbd-be2e-76d4e64a0de7.jpg?v=1758793781&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/12_15c77122-c4d1-427b-a9a4-fc82a62b7d81.jpg?v=1758793781&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/10_ef85f2d7-8086-4bbb-bbc3-56e7d0e46df2.jpg?v=1758793781&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/88.jpg?v=1758793781&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/dtress_ramble_033.jpg?v=1758793781&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/444_d3c9432d-95d8-4f89-a92e-c614c52eaaee.jpg?v=1758793781&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/14_0f56c70d-ac42-42c8-8434-e0ae4c330cc8.jpg?v=1758793781&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/2_5e40c34d-e7ce-4803-9d6a-ccb123e130e0.jpg?v=1758793781&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/11_47f20326-95eb-4824-a5b3-32ebae23b8d4.jpg?v=1758793781&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/wide_3407b5a8-7e19-4afb-b85e-6afbe946305f.jpg?v=1758793781&width=1946;sold-out;https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/products/the-ramble-1969
The Blueprints, 1950;Robert Rauschenberg and Susan Weil;FALSE;"In the summer of 1949, Susan Weil introduced her partner Robert Rauschenberg to the process of exposing blueprint paper at her family home in Connecticut. What began as a playful experiment rooted in Weil’s childhood memories soon transformed into a striking series of large-scale works. Together they laid sheets of light-sensitive paper in the sun, arranging objects and human figures to capture fleeting silhouettes and delicate traces of presence preserved in deep blue.
Though the couple would eventually part, Rauschenberg continued to work with cyanotypes throughout his career, even as Weil’s authorship quietly faded from the accepted narrative. The book stands not only as an archive of historically significant works, but as a record of a relationship and creative partnership that unfolded into marriage, parenthood, and, eventually, separation, as their lives and practices diverged.
This new publication brings together the complete collaborative works from this brief but influential period, along with unseen photographs by Wallace Kirkland, who documented their time in New York in images that reflect the erasure women artists so often faced, even within their own stories.
At the heart of the book is a new interview between Susan Weil and writer Lou Stoppard, exploring the long summer on Outer Island and the years the couple spent working side by side as young artists in New York and Paris. Designed as an intimate object, bound in litho-printed linen that carries the quiet resonance of the cyanotype, with a bellyband inspired by the sun-faded paper of the works themselves.
For all women who were abstract artists, you were investigating your complicated thoughts about being an individual and everything. It wasn’t so simple or direct as being a statement, ‘I want my place in the world’, but it was about trying to be at one with your own work and take it seriously and have a sense of force.” - Susan Weil 
“This book directs attention both to the importance of blueprints in the history of photography - particular in terms of innovations by female artists - and also, most importantly, to Susan Weil as a significant and innovative artist. It was she who set her then husband Robert Rauschenberg on a path that would later define his practice, and I am thrilled to have had the chance to tell that story, and to celebrate Weil's knowledge and vision.” -  Lou Stoppard

Place de la République;Thomas Boivin;FALSE;"In the heart of Paris stands Place de la République, a crossroads where lives briefly intersect. For five years, Thomas Boivin photographed the young Parisians who moved through it, capturing the fleeting harmony of the city.
Place de la République has long been a meeting point for the city’s demands and hopes. Since the nineteenth century it has been a stage for protests, strikes, vigils and celebrations — a space where Paris shows itself to itself. Today it remains a symbolic square for assembly and daily life, and a place where young people come to spend time, talk, wait and watch.
Boivin’s photographs form a quiet record of a generation growing up in a city that is always shifting. His camera picks out the small details,  fashion, posture, gesture, that signal how young Parisians shape who they are and how they want to be seen. Together the portraits reflect how youth finds its place in the centre of the city: claiming space, crossing paths, marking out new ideas of identity, gender and belonging in the open air of the square. 
""I began visiting Place de la République in 2018, a vast square in the centre of Paris. On warm, sunlit mornings I would return, drawn to the chance of portraying the people who gathered there.
""As the world seemed to grow more tense with each passing day, I found myself turning to youth, those on the threshold of adulthood. In their presence I glimpsed the shape of the society to come, and through them I discovered a renewed faith in our capacity to endure and to overcome the frailties of our time."" - Thomas Boivin

Tessa Boffin;Ed. Sunil Gupta;FALSE;"“Tessa Boffin” is a landmark monograph celebrating the fearless and theatrical vision a truly uncompromising queer artist.
Tessa Boffin (1960–1993) was a pioneering artist and lesbian activist working between the mid-1980s and early 1990s. Despite a brief career, taking her own life at just 33, Boffin created a deeply complex body of work that explored gender, sex positivity, and the politics of AIDS at a time of fierce cultural resistance.
Through her intricately posed tableaux, Boffin championed lesbian visibility and explored queer identity through fantastical, provocative narratives. Her practice was bold and ground-breaking, carving out space where there was little representation or acknowledgement of queer desire. Deftly weaving historical reference, critical theory and wit, she proposed an alternative lens through which to view desire, history, and power.
This monograph brings together all of the work Boffin’s made in her short career, including Angelic Rebels, The Knight’s Move and Lovers Distance, alongside a selection of commissions and collaborative works, edited and introduced by her long-time friend and collaborator Sunil Gupta.
“If we choose to forget the role transgressive fantasies play in shaping sexual identities, we leave our sense of selves and our imagery wanting. Maybe it is time to remember how we model ourselves on horny daydreams and tattered photographs.” — Tessa Boffin

American Motorcycling Culture;Jack Lueders-Booth;FALSE;"Some obsessions never let you go. For Jack Lueders-Booth, it began when he was nine years old and saw his first motorcycle and fell in love. Now Ninety, riding, racing, repairing, and rebuilding bikes has been his life’s devotion.
His new book, American Motorcycling Culture, delves into his archive from 1980 to 2000. It stands as a record of machines and the people who rode them: bikers in heavy leathers on American-made Indians, fresh-faced kids on their first ride, pro racers pushing themselves and their bikes as far as they would go. Harleys and Beemers, Beezers and Trumpets, Ducs, Hondas, Kawas, Suzukis, Yamahas.
Lueders-Booth is a singular photographer, intent on showing communities as they are, honest, imperfect, unadorned. When he wasn’t on a bike, he was behind a camera or in a classroom, teaching photography in a women’s prison, then later at Harvard, always drawn to the edges of things, to lives rarely shown in full light. These photographs carry that restless hum, the thrill and the risk, the romance and the trouble, the small freedom of choosing the open road over the humdrum.
These photographs show something of what American motorcycling culture had been at the end of the 20th century: road racers, women racers, child racers, vintage racers, enduros, motocrossers, motorcycle blessings, swap meets, street cruisers, good guys and bad guys.

Cheryomushki;Nikolay Bakharev;FALSE;"Nikolay Bakharev was born in the late 1940s in Soviet Siberia—a moment when artistic expression was strictly regulated. Orphaned at the age of four, he was placed in state care, where he first encountered photography after stumbling upon a plastic Smena camera.
In 1970, Bakharev was assigned to a job in a steel factory in Novokuznetsk, a Siberian city dominated by heavy industry. Soon after, he began working as a photographer for state-run Household Services, making official portraits in schools, factories, and public institutions.
As the Soviet Union began to unravel in the early 1980s, Bakharev turned to private portraiture. He traveled to near by river and lake beaches, such as Cheryomushk, where workers and families gathered to relax. These beaches were among the few public spaces in the USSR where any form of nudity was tolerated. “Almost any image of a naked body was considered pornography, which was against the law,” he says. Here, he created a deeply human archive of unvarnished Soviet life: intimate, unguarded portraits of people in moments of quite tenderness—parents embracing their children, couples pressed close, friends drinking in the afternoon light.
Bakharev’s camera served as means of connection. “There must be a mutual relationship,” he said. “They need to understand that I am not watching my sitters—it’s as if I’m part of the picture… A picture should not be beautiful, but interesting, then you can find beauty. Beauty is in the human relationships that are formed.”
Bakharev is also the author of Novokuznetsk published by STANLEY/BARKER in 2016, and has previously been nominated for Deutsche Börse photography prize for his 2011 exhibition at the Venice Biennale

Glass Mountain;Michael Lundgren;FALSE;"Michael Lundgren creates photographs that challenge our perception of reality. Drawn to the hallucinatory qualities of the natural world, he ventures deep into the wilder places of the Americas, searching for a hidden presence embedded in the land. 
His new book, Glass Mountain, is an uneasy meditation on transformation and the eerie sentience of the inanimate. These photographs depict places that seem to exist beyond the field of time—where stones hold memory, the earth hums with a silent awareness, and landscapes confront us with their stark, unsettling beauty. 
Through Glass Mountain, Lundgren dismantles the notion of nature as a fixed ideal. Instead, he asks us to see the Earth in a constant state of becoming.
“As humans, we once looked to the sun, the stars, and the moon as maps. We saw the planet as our home, inseparable from our own existence. We told our stories through almanacs, songlines, and paintings on the walls. But many of us now live by a different set of guides. My work is a contemplation of this shift away from an Earth-centered mythology.” — Michael Lundgren

Riverland;Marjolein Martinot;FALSE;"During times of darkness and moments of deep turmoil in her personal life, Dutch photographer and mother of six, Marjolein Martinot, found herself lost, searching for a renewed sense of self. Each evening, she sought solace in nature, walking to a nearby river in the South of France with her camera in hand. There, she captured the quiet beauty of the natural world in the golden light of dusk, forming connections with the animals and families she en- countered at the river’s edges—jumping, splashing, climbing, and swinging from the trees.
 What began as a ritual of aimless wandering and photographing soon became a form of visual journaling—a quiet meditation on healing and transformation. The water, ever-flowing and unpredictable, mirrored her own emotional state, while the families she met, however briefly, embodied the warmth and belonging she longed for.
 Through these intimate, unguarded moments—children mid-leap, ripples catching the last light of day, trees bending towards the water, and horses galloping in the fading glow—Martinot began to piece together a new sense of self. Her photographs, though  deeply personal, transcend autobiography, offering a universal reflection on resilience, connection, and the subtle magical beauty of the everyday.”

Return;Larry Clark;FALSE;"Larry Clark was 16 in 1962 when he and his friends started shooting Valo - a drug store nasal inhaler that contained a tremendous amount of amphetamine.
Clark returned to his hometown of Tulsa at 20 after two years serving in Vietnam. Here he graduated from amphetamines to heroin, and upended traditional documentary photography, by turning his camera on himself and his social circle, producing a ground-breaking series of raw and intimate photographs chronicling the disintegration of the American dream. 
Clark’s deeply intimate images exposed the previously unseen lives of suburban American teenagers, living a transgressive, outlaw lifestyle, hanging out in crash pads and committing burglaries and armed robberies to score dope. A small number of these photographs would come to form ‘Tulsa’, a cornerstone of contemporary photography. 50 years on, Larry Clark has returned to his archive of vintage prints, crafting a powerful vision of his work from 1962-1973, to produce his new book ‘Return’, a meticulously printed, outsized monograph, which is as shocking today as it ever has been, even in a moment in which opioid addiction is more prevalent than ever before.
“I’ve always been interested in small groups of marginalized people who no one would know about otherwise.  I photographed my friends over a ten-year period in this secret world that nobody else could have possibly come in and done except someone from the inside like me. You see us from the time we were teenagers up until our twenties and how everything changed and how we changed. There weren’t supposed to be drugs back then. It was supposed to be mom’s apple pie and white picket fences. When I started making work, I said, “Why can’t you show everything?” - Larry Clark

Studio 54;Tod Papageorge;FALSE;"Tod Papageorge's Studio 54 takes us inside New York's most infamous club. During the late 1970's 54 was the place to be seen, attracting thousands of people that regularly included models, actors, rock stars, artists, designers and politicians. Papageorge's exquisite photographs are filled with all the decadence and glamour that one would expect from 1970's New York.
While photographers were common, most were there to simply search out only the rich and famous, Papageorge's images transcend the obvious, transforming the glitter into something akin to poetry.
This new limited gold edition of Studio 54 celebrates 10 years since it's first publication by STANLEY/BARKER in 2014.
“The 66 photographs in this book were made between 1978–80 in Studio 54, a New York discothèque that, through those years, was the place to be and be seen, as the celebrities, partygoers, and those crazy for dancing who filled it every night were happy to prove. Unsurprisingly, given its reputation (which quickly flamed into notoriety during a short, 33-month existence), it was difficult to get into: the imperturbable doormen who doled out access as if they were controlling passage into a fabulous kingdom made sure that it would be. Only the famous or socially connected could assume they’d find themselves shooed around the flock of hopeful celebrants milling on the street side of the velvet rope and guided through the door; otherwise, the thing most likely to help was to be beautiful. Once inside, though, everyone there seemed thrilled by the fact, no matter how they’d managed it, an excitement fed by the throbbing music and brilliantly designed interiors, which, on a party night, could suggest anything from Caliban’s cave to a harem.”

No Fences;Mark McLennan;FALSE;"Perhaps nowhere on in North America is as symbolically rich as the American West. In the harsh light of day there is a disparity between what is imagined and what exists. But as the light falls, the myths that sustain the region’s collective identity are revealed.
Part love letter and part elegy, No Fences takes the viewer off the highway and into the spaces where the myth remains—in the shadows of the mountains, deep into the pine forests, and to the last open plains along the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains.
Inspired by 19th-century frontier poetry, Mark McLennan’s stunning photographs produced between 2020-2023 explore what has been lost and what persists in ranching communities between Southern Alberta and West Texas.
“Having lived abroad for a decade, I returned to the West to experience the promise of its expanse.  What I found was miles of barbed wire and no trespassing signs.  My camera allowed me to jump a few fences and encounter the remaining people and places that still embody the West’s mythic tradition, despite encroaching modernization and decay.” Mark McLennan

Holy Land U.S.A.;Lisa Barlow;FALSE;"In the Summer of 1980, Lisa Barlow was following the curve of Connecticut’s Route 69 in a beat-up rental car, when she came across a giant cross looming above the highway.
Barlow had heard about Holy Land U.S.A. but never encountered the painstaking replica in miniature of Jerusalem with illustrative scenes from the Bible, replete with precepts and biblical quotations engraved in cement. 
There was Pilate’s house, the Inn with a “No Vacancy” sign, a mummified lump spray painted white representing Lot’s wife turned to salt, and a repentant looking Lucifer locked in a small dog cage. Built 20 years earlier with concrete, plaster, wire and wood, the diorama had been sparingly repaired with modern materials such as plastic and aluminium siding. The Stairway to Heaven, cracked asphalt steps ascending the hill, had a cyclone fence along one side, and the Garden of Eden was completely obscured by thick vines under a tin sunshade. It was from there that Balow first saw the city of Waterbury spread beneath her, its church spires and factory smokestacks in odd juxtaposition with Holy Land’s little foot high buildings at her feet.
“Before long, it was more than a fascination with Holy Land that kept luring me back to Waterbury. It was the people who captured my attention, my imagination and eventually, my love. This is the story of that year in pictures.” Lisa Barlow 
Barlow’s images of Waterbury and its uniquely American idiosyncrasies are enthused with a rare empathy combined with a visual complexity that continues to unfold with each viewing. 
“These images work on me in a way that photographs rarely do, in that they really seem to move, to speak, to breathe; there’s music in them, songs and stories that rise from them unbidden.” Brad Zeller

TX I CA 19;Jason Lee;FALSE;"The quiet images of a waning American landscape featured in Jason Lee’s new book TX | CA 19 were made in June and July 2019 on a drive to California from his adopted home state of Texas. This would be the last of such photo outings before he would relocate back to his native Southern California that September.
“Many of these color photographs were made along and surrounding Highways 287 and 40/66, from Decatur, TX to California—a stretch that I’ve travelled one direction or another many times now and have become extremely fond of, making it a point to revisit certain locations and produce current photographs (collecting time-span exposures of familiar sights is for both curiosity and pleasure and remains ongoing). And so you will find quite a few scenes repeated in this companion to TX I CA 17. 
""Here, however, when in California this time, despite having photographed in the desert east of Los Angeles between Highways 40 and 10 where I’d previously made a handful of the pictures seen in the California section of 17, I didn’t expose any color film. Instead, the California images in this offering were made northbound along Highways 14/395 and 6 after departing L.A. for the drive home. A route that I don’t take often enough and did not take two years prior. Beautiful country out that way. And coincidentally it was thereabouts that I made some of my first pictures from the road when I started photographing the American landscape in 2006.“
Jason Lee is a Photographer, Actor and Skateboarder based in the United States. He is the author of several photographic books including In The Gold Dust Rush and TX I CA 17.

Moral Minority;Sergio Purtell;FALSE;"Sergio Purtell arrived in the USA in the early 1970s, having fled an imminent dictatorship in Chile, by General Augusto Pinochet. Here he glimpsed the American dream, and sought to unravel the nations mysteries as an outsider who had witnessed the capriciousness of power and the tenacity of the displaced.
Made between 1977 and the early-90s Sergio Purtell’s American photographs are imprints of life in a country fixated on its duelling myths of emancipation and conquest. From collective exuberance to rural serenity, Purtell’s images of fairs, parades and a life lived outside, display moments both commonplace and distinct. They search out under-swells of feelings that fleck public space with intimacy and interaction. They register the human tenderness that flows from rare moments of rest.
""The first thing I noticed was the lack of walls.  In Santiago, Chile, the houses were closed off and private. In Hamilton, Ohio–where I arrived in 1972 as a 17-year-old exchange student—the houses were separated by white picket fences. They were easy to leap over and neighbours were friendly. At home in Chile, I knew about America by its TV shows and films, its music and freedom and possibility. The prim white fences looked the part, a display of affluence within reach. But beyond them, I also glimpsed a sprawling, enigmatic landscape where the American dream awoke to reality. 
“Today, this country is not the same place I arrived in. A wall is being constructed along the southern border. As I made these pictures, a wall was coming down in East Berlin. Moral Minority is a meditation on this collapse of conscience. To assemble the fragments, it looks to the narratives of those pushed to the periphery, and to those who can testify to the intricate predicament between right and wrong.”

Women Prisoner Polaroids;Jack Lueders-Booth;FALSE;"In the fall of 1977, Jack Lueders-Booth began teaching photography to the inmates of MCI Framingham, a women’s prison. 
During his decade at the facility, he would make a series of Polaroid images produced collaboratively with the women who lived in the prison. 32 of these images are presented in this new book alongside oral histories taken at the time by Booth. 
Founded in 1878, MCI Framingham was opened to house incarcerated women for the crime of giving birth out of wedlock i.e., begetting, (Hester Prynne’s crime in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s 1850 novel, The Scarlet Letter). Some few years later MCI Framingham began incarcerating women for shoplifting, organised prostitution, using and trafficking drugs, armed robbery, child abuse, and murder. Many women at Framingham were convicted for helping their husbands or boyfriends commit crimes. By the Mid-70s, the correctional facility was part of an ongoing normalisation experiment that sought to mitigate the psychological consequences of incarceration. In Booth’s images, neither inmates nor guards are uniformed, cells are made to look like dormitory rooms, and inmates can furnish and decorate them within the constraints of guidelines. Male inmates were introduced, constituting 20% of the communal population. Many of the inmates in Lueders-Booth’s images had dependent children who were placed in the care of relatives or court-appointed foster parents, they were allowed to visit with an adult.
“My time there was scheduled to end in 1979, but by then I had begun photographing these women, and what began at their request grew to occupy me personally, and fully. I wished to continue and did, remaining at MCI Framingham for another 7 years, photographing, while also tutoring inmates who had a continuing interest in photography.' Jack Luders-Booth 
Included alongside Luders-Booth's images, are a series of anonymized verbal accounts, and poems taken from female prisoners at MCI Framingham Prison
For all of my sisters who have felt the weight oflife’s cruelties as the knife of life’s coldnesspierced their hearts,And all traces of warmth were drained away.they vaguely remember something called love,a distorted version of pimp,as coat hangers, baseball bats, anything inreach came at them through the airAnd afterwards their pimp says, “It’s becauseI love you baby.

Country Life;Karen Knorr;FALSE;"Karen Knorr's Country Life explores attitudes within the British aristocracy in the 1990s through image and text. Knor's refined images were taken in London, Scotland and Oxfordshire in domestic interiors and gardens laid out according to the picturesque canons of the eighteenth century. 
The work was originally commissioned by The Photographers’ Gallery for a group exhibit entitled Britain in 1984.
""Although I was asked to document changes that new technologies had created, I chose instead to refer to the attitudes and activities of the British landed gentry, These were aspects of Britain in 1984 that had changed little. Country Life, like my earlier works Belgravia (1979-81) and Gentlemen (1981-83), parodies class attitudes, the received ideas of the 1980’s under Thatcherism. (Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister 1979-1990) This series differs, in that I appropriate the still life and landscape genres to plot the traces of the leisure class. Nature, like the objects photographed, is property. Objects inside and outside serve to commemorate past family histories. Looking at Country Life today the development of labour’s classless society is still a project to be striven for.. Social networks based on favour, privilege and accidents of birth continue despite new technologies and progress."" Karen Knorr

Very Pictorial Conceptual Art;Robert Cumming;FALSE;"Robert Cumming was an American artist who defied easy classification. A painter, sculptor, photographer, and printmaker he is perhaps best known for his painstakingly constructed conceptual photographs. This new publication edited by David Campany explores Cumming’s highly influential photographic works from the 1970s.
Cumming first came to photography in the 1960s as a means of photographing his sculptural works, but a found that at a certain point, he was happier with the photographs than he was with the sculptures themselves. Cumming would go on to produce an archive of immaculate photographs of functional-looking yet perplexing constructions with an 8x10” camera from his Los Angeles studio. Each entices the viewer to look ever deeper into the image to define its elusive intention. 
'Robert Cumming was an artist so self-possessed, so unlike any other, and so consumed by his own unique set of concerns, that what he made could have come only from him. There is an entire universe of thinking, making and picturing that is pure Robert Cumming'. - David Campany

The Liquid Night;Bill Henson;FALSE;"Now out of print, limited archive copies avakble 
The images in Bill Henson’s cinematic new book The Liquid Night, derive from work the highly acclaimed artist shot on 35mm colour negative film in New York City in 1989. They present a kaleidoscopic, nocturnal journey through the frenetic, neon-lit streets of a long-lost America.
""They were shot as formal 35mm frames and served as images in quest of an artistic resolution which Bill Henson became besotted with and which he has now resolved in digital terms creating a compendium of new art which is a recapitulation of a world that has vanished like an all but forgotten dream that tugs at the mind as a set of animated emblems that no longer exist in contemporary reality.
""They revisit in the artist’s memory –– and as strange images in the spectator’s –– a world that is the instantiation of time lost and only to be recaptured by the restored function of memory. 
""Think of a hypnotic time. A jazz bar near Washington Square. The gin and tonic they would bring you like a ritual, the sacrament of an old-time religion, and the way they would shift you so that Tony Bennett could be closer to the piano which he was obsessed by. And then you would make your way back to the Algonquin and at midnight (because they closed the doors then) you would have to be let in by the bellhop whose hair turned grey, then white and Matilda the cat who endured everlastingly, through the autumn of an age into the winter of senescence.
""Originally there had been the idea of a collage work but now in The Liquid Night there are the pages with the images that have their own bygone intelligibility. Sometimes they are composed by a principle of magnification. But it was only in the last few years that Bill Henson realised how they could be exhibited. He came to love the detail, the iconoclasm of these images and the way they converged on each other. At first, nothing came into his head. But it gradually became clear that he had to show the negatives for the imprint of the life that once was. He moved around images, sometimes in extreme closeup and discovered, one more time, that it was the unbelievable beauty of film that he set out to reproduce. It included a version of the familiar Francis Bacon epiphany: the finding of the artist’s own characteristic and self-defining shape. And the form that familiar apparition took was a wild extremity of nostalgia, the kind of nostalgia that haunts Tarkovsky and is intensely and fathomlessly serious. Bradley’s jazz bar is no more and only the ghostly outline is left and is forever inseparable from the sense of loss. 
""It’s many years now since the art critic the late Peter Schjeldahl (who wrote so eloquently of Bill Henson’s work) began a lecture by announcing that Eric Fischl might just be the first great painter of the decline of American civilization. And that wry, all but whimsical pessimism, that bleak joke speaks to Bill Henson with the extraordinary uncanny sense of loss these images disclose. Where are the snows of yesteryear, where is anything, where is everything? It’s all gone, and the technology is gone. The very idiom of the world recollected in The Liquid Nighthas disappeared. The ads shown here are for cassette tapes.      
""This is the work of a photographer of genius recreating the discardable mystery of his past.""
-Peter Craven

Brantville;Melinda Blauvelt;FALSE;"In 1972, Melinda Blauvelt traveled to the small Acadian fishing village of Brantville, New Brunswick on Canada's Eastern coast. She lived with a fisherman and his family, ran a day camp, and made a series of remarkable, compassionate portraits of the Acadian community that summer and on three subsequent visits from 1972 to 1974. Her photographs are now published as a series for the first time.
Melinda Blauvelt was in the first class of women at Yale and then the first woman in Yale's MFA photography program where Walker Evans became her mentor. Blauvelt would later teach at Harvard and at the University of Virginia where she established the photography program. Her pictures are held by major museums throughout the United States. She lives today in a small village on the coast of Rhode Island.
“I bought a used Deardorff 4x5 camera and spent the summer making photographs in Brantville, where I lived with fisherman Ulysse Thibodeau, his wife Jeannette and their three young children. Weekdays were spent with the campers making puppets and performing “Le Corbeau et Le Renard”, playing Capture the Flag and Croquet. Weekends, Ulysse and Jeannette took us fishing for mackerel, to the beach and included us in family dinners, bingo, picnics, and birthday parties. Whenever I set up my Deardorff, the Thibodeaus, their extended family and other Brantville friends were my enthusiastic collaborators.” - Melinda Blauvelt

Ménilmontant;Thomas Boivin;FALSE;"Thomas Boivin's photographic novella takes us on an intimate, meandering journey through the coffee, shops and apartments of a bohimian Parisian neighbourhood, Ménilmontant
Nestled in the North-East of the city, between Belleville and the Père Lachaise Cemetery, Ménilmontant was once the city's industrial heart but is now known for its bohemian community. 
""In autumn 2009, I moved to Ménilmontant. I had recently discovered photography and when I arrived there, my life pivoted entirely. In a few short months, I had decided to become a photographer, found a night job as a commercial photographer and bought a few hundred rolls of film. I started working by night and walking by day and, for the next ten years, my life’s rhythm was set. 
Recently, looking through my archive, I found many images that I had until now left aside, often unconsidered. One by one, I rediscovered them. Still lifes, street life, friends and strangers alike are gathered here in what is a personal evocation of these years. Yet I hope that they convey a feeling that is not only mine, but distinctly Parisian, and might echo the memories of whoever lived the first years of his adult life in the North East of Paris."" - Thomas Boivin 
Boivin's exquisite analogue black-and-white photographs, printed in a rich open tritone are presented in an elegant design inspired by the countless classic French novels, to be found for sale on the banks of the Seine.

Come Out;Sunil Gupta;FALSE;"When Sunil Gupta moved to London from New York in the late 70s, he was surprised to find no equivalent of New York's Christopher Street. All the gays and lesbians appeared to be in hiding. Only to be encountered in a handful of pubs and after-hours clubs, which closed very early. However, this was about to change with the development and growth of the 1970s fledgeling gay marches into the more significant numbers of more confident people who came out in gay public protests.
The photographs in this new book encompass the period from the mid to late 1980s and recount Pride marches before corporate sponsors, and their logos, as well as specific marches that were responding to a single event; antinuclear CND protests and demonstrations supporting the miners’ strikes, and of course, the several protests against Clause 28 -  a legislative designation for a series of laws across Britain that prohibited the ""promotion of homosexuality"" by local authorities. Introduced by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government, it was in effect from 1988 to 2000 in Scotland and from 1988 to 2003.
""Photography was also in the middle of a great documentary debate at that time, questions arose regarding shooting political marches, who was taking the pictures and for which purpose. I wanted to make my point of view very clear, which was that of someone from within the community. And it was my community."" - Sunil Gupta
Born in New Delhi, India, relocated to Montreal, Canada, before studying at the Royal College of Art in London, Gupta has been using photography as a critical practice since the 1970s.  Subversive, impulsive, personal and political, Sunil Gupta's socially engaged projects have focused on such issues as family, race, migration and the complexities and taboos of sexuality and homosexual life. His work has been instrumental in raising awareness around the political realities concerning the fight for international gay rights and of making visible the tensions between tradition and modernity, public and private, the body and body politics.

At The Beach;Tod Papageorge;FALSE;"In 1975 Tod Papageorge made a cross-America trip that ended on the beaches of Los Angeles. There, taken by the blinding light, he produced some of his first medium-format (6 x 9 cm) photographs. In 1978 he returned to Los Angeles to expand on those first pictures and, in 1981 and 1988, on shorter visits, added yet again to this body of work. Here, he writes about “At the Beach”:
“I think that part of what these beach pictures are about is the difference between our preconceptions of a place and what, when we get there, that place turns out to be. In this case (of Los Angeles and its coastline), I think it’s also fair to suggest that those preconceptions are particularly strong, shaped as they irresistibly have been by the movies and popular music. So, as a first point, what I wanted to do on this project was examine those preconceptions (at least as I conjured them) through the descriptive power of photography in order to pin down what two semi-myths - the world of surfers and the life of southern California beaches –‘really’ looked like.
“To describe a place and yet at the same time reinvent it is a double intention on the part of the photographer that we should be used to by now when we look at and think about photographs. It seems to be a contradiction built into interesting pictures, if not the medium of photography itself. With these pictures, then, I worked with the belief that the closer I came to describing the literal nature of the place and people I was photographing, the more surprising the pictures that came out of that process might be. All while transforming (I hoped), the casual, unselfconscious physicality of these beachgoers moving from the boardwalks onto the sand and back again into form and meaning.
“I'm speaking of what I hoped for the photographs, of course - they may not describe these things at all. But whether I'm right or wrong about these particular pictures, it should go without saying that a good photograph must, in some palpable sense, distinguish what it describes.”
Tod Papageorge is an American photographer and teacher who began his photographic career on the streets of New York City in the middle-1960s. Between 1979 and 2013, he directed the graduate photography program at the Yale University School of Art. He is well-known for his photographs of Studio 54, a body of work from the late 70s that was published by Stanley/Barker in 2014.

Megalith-Still;Mimi Plumb;FALSE;"Mimi Plumb's breathtaking monograph Megalith-Still is a meditation on the sublime within the untamed American landscape.
Shipping world wide day of order.
Each summer from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, the acclaimed photographer travelled from her home in San Francisco to Kings Canyon, a wilderness where she communed with a band of horses. Plumb would come to produce Megalith-Still, a series of portraits of the herd, imbued with a deep tenderness, and powerful physic weight.
“The horses sleep lying down, legs twitching, mouths wrapped around blades of grass. The flies are attracted to their moist, flickering eyes. I’m as close as I can focus, examining their faces, tails, hooves and bellies, bewitched by the sensuality of horse and place.
“I am in a meadow high in the Sierra Nevada. Channels of the San Joaquin River braid through the thick, lush grass. I take off my shoes and socks, roll up my pants and wade through the shallow water to where the horses are now eating. They trace a pattern, mysterious to me, around and around the meadow, eating, drinking, and sleeping.
“Late in the afternoon, the horses abruptly leave the meadow in a single line. I race after them through a swamp of thick mud and dead trees and branches which scratch my arms. They trot and canter, moving faster than they’ve moved all day. I can’t catch up to them. When I reach the edge of the main riverbank, I see the last of the horses cautiously step into the deep, swift-moving water, and slowly float to the other side.” - Mimi Plumb
Three-quarter bound in a uniquely tactile fibrous wool paper (produced using surplus from the fashion industry) and expertly printed in tritone, Mimi Plumb’s Megalith-Still is a truly timeless publication.

Polaroid Kid;Mike Brodie;FALSE;"At the age of 17, Mike Brodie left home, hoping a freight train to Jacksonville, Florida. His first trip lasted little more than a few days but was the start of a lifelong journey that would see him become one of the most intuitive photographers of his generation.On finding an abandoned Polaroid camera stuffed behind a car seat in 2004, Brodie began to produce a sprawling document of his journey riding the rails across the expanse of North America, alongside a tight-knit community of young punks and hobos, all searching for an authentic experience of the life less ordinary.This new collection of masterfully reproduced polaroids was made by Brodie when travelling under the name The Polaroid Kid. The 50 polaroids are presented in a bespoke silkscreened grey-board case, fastened by a heavy gauge elastic band - a design inspired by the punk ethos that the people pictured lived by, and the utilitarian train cars in which they ride.

One Brief Moment;Dave Heath;FALSE;"By the age of four Dave Heath had been abandoned by both of his parents. By the age of fifteen he had lived in a series of foster homes and, finally, in an orphanage. 
In 1947, Heath saw Ralph Crane’s photo-essay “Bad Boy’s Life” in LIFE Magazine. Struck by the success of how succinctly these pictures connected to a deeply felt shared experience, Heath knew he wanted to become a photographer. Using the orphanage’s darkroom, he began to master the mechanics of the medium.
In the early 1960s, working in the streets on North Eastern American Cities, Heath used its inhabitants to capture individual moments in tightly structured compositions that are charged with the importance of their individuality and the seriousness of their situation.
On speaking about his collection of vernacular photographs Heath said ""When I was 25, I had five photographs from my past, snapshots of myself and my foster family, and one of my mother and father, and I tore them up - because I wanted to purify myself, to cleans the background out of my system. And I think now that I shouldn't have done that, because I’ve collected all these old photographs to replace those five. So in a sense shoes five have generated themselves into thousands. In a way it’s like trying to recreate, through these old photographs, a family album of my own for a family I never had. On a simple, kind of emotional level that's my motivation for collecting these photographs. And in the beginning there was all this intense feeling of trying to reclaim from oblivion all these people, all these images of people, which were destined just to disappear."" - Dave Health  
This new book reproduces Heath's original prints, many of which only exist as individual work prints, with beautiful precision.

The Orange Line;Jack Lueders-Booth;FALSE;"Jack Lueders-Booth's The Orange Line is a tenderly produced archive of a community that lived and worked along the southern route of Boston Public Transportation’s Orange Line: an antiquated, clattering, overhead railway that was constructed in 1901. The pavement vibrating din of this deteriorating railway, its unsightliness, its increasing crime rate, and its inefficiency depressed property values in the neighbourhoods that it served. An unintended consequence was affordable housing for this largely low-income population. 
In 1985, the southern section of the Orange Line was scheduled for demolition and rerouting, which seeded fears of rising rents, possible displacement, and the loss of public transportation to metropolitan Boston. Change seemed imminent, and displacement probable. 
“These photographs were made in the interest of preserving some record of the people who lived and worked along the southern stretch of Boston’s Orange Line.” - Jack Lueders-Booth 
In 1970, Jack Lueders-Booth left a business career at age 35 to pursue photography. He taught photography at Harvard University from 1970 to 1999 where he was three times nominated for Harvard’s Joseph P. Levinson Memorial Award for Outstanding Teaching.  He then went on to teach photography at The Rhode Island School of Design, Tufts University, The school of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and The Art institute of Boston.

Paris Opera;Bill Henson;FALSE;"In the early 1990’s Bill Henson was commissioned by the Paris Opera to produce a series of works that were to bring the emotional effect of music into visual form. For the first time, all 50 images from the series are brought together as a delicately printed outsized monograph. 
“Paris Opera is a development for Henson both in his use of colour and in the way he presents human faces in interplay through convention, the framing device, of the face intent on music: whether in appreciation or indifference, or with an inscrutable self-possession. Watching faces, lit from below, sit in half-light suggests that the only illumination comes from the stage and what these faces suggest is always a revelation of some inwardness before the other event: the musical drama unfolding in front of their eyes. The drama of portraiture in response is instead intensely dramatic and Henson has done wonders to make his camera suggest the gradations and modulations of a painterly apprehension. It is drama full of shadow and chiaroscuro, of Rembrandtian depths of brown and gold and blackest green.
"" Henson is never afraid to suggest some portent just out of reach. Indeed, it plays on the possibility like a piano; that is one reason why the simulacrum of high art is so manifest in these most painterly of Henson’s pictures. They are in one-way photographic representations of the nature and effect of art, their occasion is how a face may look as it listens, but they are in a fuller sense, attempts to instantiate the idea of art, that is to say the idea of the experience of art, without any recourse to the literary or intertextual obviousness.
"" As with all of Henson’s work there is a sense of drama, a manifest subject - here are the people formally dressed to sit and listen but beyond this naturalising of a complex and allusive assignment this Henson series is an encapsulated history of how the face may be seen when it looks away into something other.
""It would be tiresome and intrusive to read each of these photographs as if they disclosed a history when it is partly their ability to exhaust any number of histories which gives them their power, which endows their painterly literalism of hue and ‘texture’; it is their apparent belief in the power of the eye to highlight psychology and moral significance which makes us believe in their status and origin as photographs.
""Perhaps the most definitive of all these images is of a man in his 60s to the left of the frame with a young son, in late pre-puberty. I have heard the image described as everything from an embodiment of the world of the Godfather films to a symbolic portrait of the great Australian novelist  Patrick White. Perhaps it is all of these things. The man in three-quarter profile and in full evening dress, listens to what might be the overture of The Magic Flute for what might be the ten thousandth time. The intimations of sexual and general enchantment, the mighty cord betokening the mystery of what things mean, none of this tells him anything new. The face is consummate with knowledge, it is not only the face of anything our civilisation may have to teach, it is also the face of someone who has experienced the point of that knowledge, a face however civilised, which is in part depraved by the experience art reflects and gives shape to. This is a face so ripe it knows it will die. But the boy, the boy is off elsewhere, Papageno’s flute is calling, the music of Sarastro is the music of God’s goodness not the dread of his power. The boy sniffs the air. His life is all before him.
""Only art of great value can be talked about in this way, as if its executive means were the merest footnote to its content and significance."" - Peter Craven, Extract from Paris Opera

Florida Strawberries;Anthony Blasko;FALSE;"“Local fairs and carnivals have a long history in America. Even as we lose our connection to our agricultural past, there is something timeless about gathering at the fair.” - Anthony Blasko
Since 2013 the American artist Anthony Blasko has been attending The Plant City Strawberry Festival, an 11-day community event celebrating the annual strawberry harvest in Florida, USA. 
Blasko’s beautifully rich images are produced at dusk, when the light starts to drop and the fair lights come on, bathing the attractions, vendors, and visitors, in the late afternoon light.

Gloire Immortelle;Rachidi Bissiriou;FALSE;"In 1968, the West African photographer Rachidi Bissiriou set up his photographic studio, Studio Plaisir, in his hometown of Kétou in Benin, which he operated until its closure in 2004. The timing of this was conspicuous – Bissiriou was only 18 and Benin had only declared its independence from French rule eight years earlier, in 1960. Armed with a Yashica twin-lens camera, Bissiriou documented these heady times, spending the next three decades shooting black and white photographs of the locals in a standard 6x6cm format. 
While traditional portraits from these times often showcased their subjects unsmiling and with a rigid formality, Bissiriou’s images are remarkable for their simplicity and a freshness that feels utterly contemporary. Shot against plain backdrops, or in the town where they lived, Bissiriou’s subjects posed wearing their own clothing, which could range from traditional West African attire such as grand boubou, head wraps and Ankara agbadas, to more modern styles that nodded to the explosion in youth culture at the time. The image of two men – each wearing shirts unbuttoned to their sternum, paired with flared trousers, or a group of three women in sunglasses posing proudly with their handbags clearly demonstrate the post-independence verve. Bissiriou’s skill was in forging a connection with his subjects, being able to put them at ease, and allowing their innate sense of self-expression to shine through. His camera often captured his subjects in a moment of quiet repose, by turns self-possessed, contemplative, and optimistic.
For Bissiriou, the desire to become a photographer was in his own words, 'because someone who is a photographer has the freedom to go anywhere and everywhere.' While the primary focus of his nearly three decades of photography were the residents and families of his hometown, the images are no less transportive, instantly painting a vivid picture of West African society during a ground-breaking moment of transformation.

Vacation;Judith Black;FALSE;"In 1986, the American artist Judith Black was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship with the intention of documenting a cross-country road trip with her four children. Unlike Robert Frank’s iconic Guggenheim-funded road trip 30 years earlier, Black’s mission was much more intimate. Rather than documenting America, her intention was to photograph her children, friends, and family as she traversed the country. Her itinerary included stops in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and various sights along the way.
During the trip, Black visited her aunt at the Michigan cabin, where as a child Black and her family went each August to avoid the brutal summer heat of her hometown Springfield, Illinois. Ironically, it was there at the age of seven that Black purchased her first Brownie camera, while staying with her grandmother. 
After returning to Massachusetts, Black continued photographing family and friends during vacations, recording various celebrations, birthdays, reunions, and births.
“Sweet memories and histories embedded in each photograph.” - Judith Black

Streets of Boston;Mike Smith;FALSE;"After an unfortunate event on the streets of Boston in 1976, resulting in a head injury to an angry man while working with a 35mm camera, the American artist Mike Smith traded in his his Leica for a Linhof Press 23 camera, and moved away from spontaneous street photography to a more intimate portraits. 
He would go on to produce a detailed record of the inhabitants of Boston’s streets in an inclusive, non-judgmental, and yet direct approach. Smith worked with a large camera with an even larger flat unit, a formidable machine that got peoples attention and held it long enough for him to complete the related tasks to operate it successfully. 
“The driving force, above of all, was my whole-hearted embrace of the photography as a way of life. As a Vietnam veteran (where I first discovered the medium) at the age of twenty, for the first time, I believed I had a future to pursue.” - Mike Smith

Summer After;Lucas Foglia;FALSE;"“This is how I remember New York City during the first summer after the September 11 attacks. Workers were removing the last of the debris from the collapsed Twin Towers. I was 19 years old and had just moved to Manhattan from my family’s small farm on Long Island. The city felt both immense and fragile.”

“I photographed that summer because I wanted to show New York City healing, both in celebration and unity, and with some scars. I walked through the five boroughs with my camera. When someone made eye contact with me, I asked if I could make a portrait of them. At first, I assumed people would respond with caution. I was a stranger. The city was recovering from an event that shook its sense of security. Yet, most people said yes and looked straight into my camera lens. I am grateful they chose to trust me.” - Lucas Foglia

Lovers: Ten Years On;Sunil Gupta;FALSE;"In 1984 SUNIL GUPTA’s first long term relationship broke down in shortly after he arrived in London in 1984. He had met his lover in the early 1970’s when the impact of the gay movement upon the consciousness of gay men was just gaining ground.
Then, gay was good, and gay was proud. The laws against gay sex had been turned back. The definition of homosexuality as a psychiatric disorder was successfully challenged. The commercial scene and the visibility of gay men expanded to unprecedented levels. Although, while all this change provided the individual with the means for unstigmatised sexual experimentation in relatively safe venues, simultaneously it hardly dented social attitudes and legal structures which oppressed gay relationships. 
The arrival of HIV/AIDS changed all that. Gay men came under attack, from the state and its various channels. The media mounted a vicious campaign to label gay men as sick and irresponsible. Gay men were almost exclusively represented as ill. Patients of some incurable disease that had been equated with their sexuality. On the strength of this fallacy once again there was talk of reinstating repressive laws. Once again “expert medical advisors” were in on the act with their labels and talk of “containment.”
Couples though had come into their own. Gay self-help groups encouraged a change in sexual behaviour and a reduction in the number of partners. However, still without legal recognition, with the new emphasis on monogamy, with social attitudes reverting to hostility and given the invisibility of day-to-day life for gay men within relationships, being a partner in the 1980s proved to be as difficult as it had been decades ago.
“These photographs were made in London. The couples define themselves as such by various criteria; some live together, some don’t, some have been together a short time, some a very long time, and soon. I believe the relationship between gay men is an important but often neglected component central to their lives.” - Sunil Gupta 
SUNIL GUPTA FROM HERE TO ETERNITY will be exhibited at the Photographers’ Gallery London in September 2020

Elv;Massimo Leardini;FALSE;"“We step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.” Heraclitus of Ephesus 
MASSIMO LEARDINI is an Italian photographer who has been based in the Norway for the past 30 years where he works with a small number of models on extended collaborations. 
This new publication ELV (Norwegian for River) explores Leardini’s fascination with the body and the landscape. Presenting a series of transcendental images of contorted fragments of the female body, set deep within in the primordial forests of Scandinavia. The map that Leardini unfolds is not built, but behaves like a puzzle in the imagination. 
The photographs were made in summers between 2014 and 2019 when the Scandinavian light lengthens the shadows due to the obliqueness with which the sun reaches this part of the world. This causes the light to draw the silhouettes of the subjects on the background with a high but delicate contrast.

Cop;Christopher Anderson;FALSE;"Christopher Anderson began photographing New York City cops in the wake of 9/11, as the visual landscape of the city he called home began to change. Bomb blast barriers went up, cops carrying larger guns seemed to be everywhere, and whilst the increased presence of security was designed, in part, to make New Yorkers feel safe, it reminded Anderson that something was deeply wrong.
Then, in the wake of Occupy Wall Street, the death of Eric Garner and the election of Trump, Anderson found himself making photographs of cops on the streets of New York City once again, as a form of unconscious protest on a larger sense of authority.
Anderson is a member of Magnum. He first gained recognition in 1999 when his poignant images of the rescue of Haitian refugees taken onboard a sinking wooden boat won him the Robert Capa Gold Medal. His previous book Approximate Joy was widely regarded as one of the best books of 2018.

Women's Market;Tom Wood;FALSE;"From 1978 to 1999 British photographer Tom Wood spent his Saturday mornings at Great Homer Street Market, a retail market, just far enough outside the centre of Liverpool in the North of England, for it to have it’s own unique, more relaxed identity. Complete with his Leica and out of date film, Wood made vibrant photographs of the shoppers as they hunted for bargains and met up with friends and family.
 
“I was first introduced to Great Homer Street market in 1975, by a girlfriend with family in Dingle, Liverpool. At that time, I bought two double breasted Worsted wool three piece suits and a three buttoned pin stripe suit with turn ups, for a total of four pounds. I thought, “what a great market!” It was vast then down both sides of the street, but by the time I began to photograph the second-hand clothes had all but disappeared. Yet the market was still crowded with the same mothers and daughters who for generations had frequented “Greatie” - Tom Wood

Southern Sudan;George Rodger;FALSE;"“In the heart of the Sudan, and to the west of the White Nile, there is a strange and unreal land which the hand of time has hardly touched in passing.” - George Rodger 
Between 1939 and 1947 founder member of the newly formed Magnum Photos, George Rodger served as a war correspondent for Life magazine, covering some of the most violent atrocities of the second word war: from the brutality of the Burma campaign, to horrific piles of corpses and desperately emaciated survivors discovered at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp after its liberation in 1945. 
At the start of 1948, in search of something less barbaric, Rodger arranged with the Sudanese government to be the first authorised photographer to document indigenous people of the Nuba mountains, in the former central Sudanese province of Kordofan, and the Latuka and other tribes of southern Sudan. In doing so, he created some of the most historically important and influential images taken in sub-Saharan Africa during the twentieth century.

School of Art;Matthew Finn;FALSE;"In 1997 “Cool Britannia” was at its height. Brit pop was flooding the airwaves, a new Labour government took power, and a sense of hope that had not been felt for a generation was palpable. 
British photographer Matthew Finn was 24, had recently graduated, and took a job at a School of Art in the outskirts of London. Over the coming year he photographed the students and the school itself.
“It was last decade before cell phones and social media, we discussed, argued and tried things out, not because we were told to but be cause we wanted to. Everything seemed possible.” - Matthew Finn
“We were able to expand our creativity in any direction we wanted. Hot boxing the car in the car park at lunch then going into class to swirl paint around a canvas. Chain smoking, listening to Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam on loop on the communal tape to tape deck, skateboarding in the corridors, mushrooms in the street, paper mache boobs, tampon sculptures, I can’t imagine any other form of education being that life changing.” - School of Art Student

Stilled;Edward Dimsdale;FALSE;"Edward Dimsdale is a master printmaker who over the past three decades has explored and adapted historical methods of photographic print making to produce breathtakingly beautiful, emotionally charged photographs.
Dimsdale's book Stilled shares something with the Haiku, which often presents three elements: something permanent, something ephemeral, and what happens in the moment when they come together.
The starting point for Dimsdale’s analogue prints is often something very simple, a detail, a moment, a gesture. It could be as particular as a glance from a trainee Geisha or the barren branches of a tree against a winter sky.
Once in the darkroom, Dimsdale undertakes a complex procedure to try to recapture something of the sensation he felt while making the photograph. From a film negative, he makes a series of paper inter-negatives, a technique that degrades certain aspects of the image, whilst enhancing others — a contemporary refinement of a historical method, rather like photocopying a photocopy.ISBN — 9780995555570Edition — 750Pages — 24Images — 24Cover — Newsprint / Foil stamped sticker Size — 400x578mm";https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/DJB8103.jpg?v=1755262804&width=1946;https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/DJB8117.jpg?v=1755262858&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/DJB8104.jpg?v=1755262858&width=1946|https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/cdn/shop/files/DJB8110.jpg?v=1755262858&width=1946;sold-out;https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/products/stilled
Gentlemen;Karen Knorr;FALSE;"Karen Knorr’s Gentlemen takes us inside the hallowed halls of the most venerable private gentlemen’s clubs of 1980s London, and considers the patriarchal values of the English upper classes with beautifully precise photographs and texts constructed out of speeches of parliament and the news at that time.
The complete series of 26 images and texts investigate the values that ally these classes to conservative aristocratic values where primogeniture (the right by law of the rstborn son to inherit his parent’s estate, in preference to daughters) is still an issue. Until the early 1970’s a married women still needed her husband’s endorsement for any household purchases. Whilst women now have full property rights, they still remain under-represented in key positions of governance and in nancial and academic worlds. It is still a boys club in which some women are honorary members.
With equality on the agenda and calls for more to be done, the timely release of Gentlemen — the follow up to the critically acclaimed Belgravia (Published November 2015) uses humour to explore attitudes amongst the English establishment in the 1980’s. Knorr noted that despite being Prime Minister and head of the Conservative party, Margaret Thatcher as a woman was not then, nor would be now, allowed full membership at the Conservative Gentlemen’s club ‘The Carlton’. Old Etonians, like the former British Prime Minister prime minister David Cameron, have belonged to such Gentlemen’s clubs. It is in these clubs that behind the scenes influence is still used to influence politics and business today.
