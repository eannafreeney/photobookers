Juarez,Terry Allen,false,"ISBN 978-1-59005-569-4

Hardcover, 8.5 x 11 inches, 108 pages, 12 duotone plates

You got to open your life to some better things You got to open your soul like a door

Terry Allen’s landmark concept album, released on vinyl in 1975, was a multimedia production that combined an epic Western narrative with finely detailed, fantastical lithographs to create a “better thing” that still remains fresh 47 years later. The Juarez lyrics, published here for the first time in narrative form, are paired with a series of new etchings by the artist created specifically for this project. The etchings reflect Allen’s intensely creative imagination and are a superb counterpoint to the strange and compelling storyline of his Juarez song cycle.

In a 2019 interview with the LA Louver Gallery, Allen recalls asking himself, “How can I put music and drawing together? How can I make it be one thing?” This longing to combine art forms into “one thing” has informed a body of work that includes 13 albums of original songs, radio and theatrical performances, painting, sculpture, and art installations. The Juarez storyline is a tangle of longing, loneliness, violence, and the endless, competing human desires to leave, to stay, to escape, to turn back. Two couples – Jabo and Chic, Sailor and Alice – are young, impetuous, and imperiled by their rash, even criminal, actions, and yet their story remains as forceful and vigorous as it did when he first wrote it. “Juarez is an ongoing project that began in the late sixties, runs to the present, and I have no doubt is still lurking in some form or another in the future. It has probably instigated and/or informed everything I’ve ever made,” said Allen.

Terry Allen was raised in Lubbock, Texas, graduated from Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles, California, and has worked as an artist and musician since 1966. He has received numerous awards and honors including a Guggenheim Fellowship and National Endowment for the Art Fellowships. His songs have been recorded by such diverse artists as: Bobby Bare, Guy Clark, Little Feat, Robert Earl Keen, David Byrne, Colin Gilmore, Doug Sahm, Ricky Nelson, Cracker, and Lucinda Williams. Allen’s works are held in major private and public collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC, The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the L.A. County Museum of Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego, and the Houston Museum of Fine Art.

Tales from the City,Joshua Amirthasingh,false,"The essence of Joshua Amirthasingh’s work lies in the stories it unfolds. Fueled by a deep sense of nostalgia for the vibrant energy of his childhood in India and his love of cinematic storytelling, Amirthasingh has created a dreamlike document of his adopted city of San Francisco.

Within the everyday bustle of San Francisco, Amirthasingh seeks out quiet moments, using the city's unique interplay of golden hour light—casting a warm, nostalgic glow—and ethereal fog, which creates a dreamy, evocative atmosphere. This interplay becomes a character in itself, adding another layer to the stories he weaves with his camera. Tales from the City offers a conversation between the familiar and the unexpected, inviting viewers to engage with the stories embedded within and to embark on their own journeys through their pasts.Beautifully printed in four colors on natural matte art paper, and bound in linen over boards, this first printing of Tales from the City is limited to 1,000 copies and is published to coincide with the 2025 San Francisco Art Book Fair.","ISBN: 978-1-59005-616-5Hardcover, 10.5x13 inches, 48 pages, 28 four-color plates.NOW SHIPPINGNote to European customers: please visit our UK website: www.nazraeli.co.uk",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/0a0633eb-24b2-4c70-a99b-448848fa1dbe/00Amirthasingh-Cvr-Blue.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/e48edabd-b4e1-4f31-a11e-38a07c1e9301/01+Blue.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/0c095a20-7265-46c4-96a6-e3f3448eb94b/02+Blue.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/85b3cb65-e49f-4bac-8d60-258183b3d93f/03+Blue.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/08db38bc-78da-4879-8645-0f315d849b47/04+Blue.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/a04b3f40-e3ee-40cd-b3e9-e7999dcf4cc9/05+Blue.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/c687a541-c50b-4b34-8b05-971f9edd7337/06+Blue.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/7c134068-00e3-46a2-994d-b73cd894d84f/07+Blue.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/813e26b7-d605-415b-b63d-72c4388d5c33/8+Blue.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/daa12f0d-3b70-4b18-b54e-b6b1cacf591f/09+Blue.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/88089942-959e-4cb8-a926-c40b6d8bbdc2/10+Blue.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/add9aab8-00a1-4ac6-8859-67cc879d93fc/11+Blue.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/c48a30a6-38d2-4fc6-9991-0221fb5afc9c/12+Blue.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/joshua-amirthasingh-tales-from-the-city
American Portraits 1979-1989,Leon Borensztein,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-305-8Hardcover, 11 x 13, 96 pages, 60 duotone plates.

After emigrating to the United States from Poland, Leon Borensztein took a fly-by-night job as a traveling portrait photographer, visiting homes and businesses across the country and making portraits for working-class clientele in the style of the Sears Portrait Studios. During these sessions, Borensztein would set up a generic backdrop behind the subject, while moving the camera back far enough so that the camera captured glimpses of the subjects’ personal spaces or belongings. The resulting body of work provides a rich sociological document; individually, these are some of the most compelling and touching portraits of their time. Leon Borensztein is an internationally renowned photographer whose work has appeared in Life, Harper's, The New York Times Magazine, and Vogue International. His photographs can be found in the collections of major museums such as the Art Institute of Chicago, Bibliotèque Nationale, Paris, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The recipient of a Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship, Borensztein lives and works in Oakland, California.

Two Places on Earth,Chan Chao,false,"ISBN 978-1-59005-550-2

Hardcover, 8.25 x 11 inches, 92 pages, 55 four-color plates



Two Places on Earth is a collection of 54 color photographs taken by American artist Chan Chao over a five-year period beginning in the early 2000s. The volume features two seemingly unrelated populations: UN peacekeepers in Cyprus and female prisoners in Peru. Both groups are multinational, representing 15 countries, and most of the subjects are young adults whose lives “have been shaped by global forces and personal choices,” according to the artist.

Chao’s work is restrained, showing a deep respect for the dignity and individualism of each person. He juxtaposes the two groups, who are unknown to each other but who share the commonality of being global citizens who are away from home. The soldiers guard a 111-mile buffer zone in Cyprus, dividing ethnic Greeks (Greek Cypriots) to the south and ethnic Turks (Turkish Cypriots) to the north; and the women serve prison sentences in Santa Monica Women’s Prison for attempting to smuggle cocaine out of Peru. Their respective labels fall away as the viewer examines the portraits, each a finely detailed record of the subject’s expression, body language, and humanity.

Chan Chao was born in 1966 in Kalemyo, Burma (now Myanmar). His family moved to the United States in 1978. He attended the University of Maryland, College Park, and now lives in the Washington, D.C. area. Chao’s photographs are in the permanent collections of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC; LA County Museum of Art; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Two Places on Earth is his fourth book.

Two Places on Earth is printed in a first edition of 500 casebound copies, each with an original print tipped-in to the front cover. The book opens with an introduction by Kim Sajet, Director of the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery.",SHIPPING DECEMBER 2022,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667426831288-YO2JI59HGDWHFHAZDCV1/Chao_0_Cvr.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667426836635-KVO9ECVGGETROP2D826W/Chao_01.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667426836803-FJQHRO10DEZMNVGX86GN/Chao_02.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667426837548-H5DGBKTBYWNXDCC8EADU/Chao_03.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667426837560-HMPSG45DEKGCM96XJYGS/Chao_04.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667426837453-2LCU8X5MCMD5WFM4O2N9/Chao_06.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667426849572-3EO0MS365P39ZW1LPY4E/Chao_07.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667426849817-FGJIRPZD3MRRSJI9CQ45/Chao_08.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667426850816-3ZHC6J8HQB6KYXQB28YT/Chao_09.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667426850582-LXAOWAD93JC9ND7WDS0M/Chao_10.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667426850812-3CS4SZCM9SHZM4RYWCX6/Chao_11.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667426850609-NACTB44NO0BQ8PDJ0BJ0/Chao_12.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667426866351-B3B41K1M1WSTA6NRNJIF/Chao_13.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667426866514-EBBDOSZJQ9VE616BC38B/Chao_14.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/chan-chao-two-places-on-earth

Hardcover, 10 x 13 inches, 80 pages, 60 duotone plates

“Keep Close to Nature’s Heart . . . and break clear away, once in a while, and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods. Wash your spirit clear.”' — John Muir, 1838–1914

Nazraeli Press is pleased to announce our remastered and expanded edition of Jeffrey Conley’s second monograph, Reverence. Originally published in 2018, Reverence sold out upon publication and has since become a collectible and sought-after monograph.

Known for his meticulously crafted black and white prints, which have been widely exhibited and collected in the United States and abroad, Jeffrey Conley has been the subject of four monographs and seen his work exhibited and collected by public and private institutions throughout the United States and Europe. Conley lives and works in the Willamette Valley of Oregon.

This new and expanded edition of Winter is printed in duotone on natural art paper, bound in linen, and is limited to 1,500 copies.

For as long as I can remember I have felt most at peace outdoors. Nature has always been my refuge and sanctuary. I find the natural world to be endlessly wondrous in its range of character and texture, from moments of delicate intimacy and subtlety to the massively expansive and powerful. Nature is in constant change, and photography is particularly well suited to capture and amplify the swirling fluidity and the wonderfully serendipitous moments born of the ephemeral. Photographing nature is a very specific kind of exercise in mindfulness; to be out in nature with senses responsive, keenly aware of circumstances and completely receptive, yielding to the present. The photographs in this book represent some of my observations while investigating nature over these last several years; moments that represent my awe, wonder, and affinity towards our Earth. — Jeffrey Conley

Winter,Jeffrey Conley,false,"ISBN 978-1-59005-600-4

Hardcover, 10 x 13 inches, 80 pages, 60 duotone plates

Jeffrey Conley's first monograph, Winter, was published by Nazraeli Press in 2011. It comprised a selection of 42 images of the essence of “winter”, quickly selling out and becoming a highly collectible monograph. Since this first publication, Conley has matured into one of the most accomplished landscape photographers of our time. We are now pleased to announce a new and remastered edition of this important first book, which includes 18 additional images as well as the original 42, all remastered and reproduced to the highest standards on Korean art paper.

Known for his meticulously crafted black and white prints, which have been widely exhibited and collected in the United States and abroad, Conley has been the subject of four monographs and seen his work exhibited and collected by public and private institutions throughout the United States and Europe. Conley lives and works in the Willamette Valley of Oregon.

This new and expanded edition of Winter is printed in duotone on natural art paper, bound in linen, and is limited to 1,500 copies.

Having grown up in the northeastern United States, I can vividly remember the childhood feeling of waking up on a Winters’ morning and looking out the window at a magical, snow covered world. I was enthralled with the ethereal qualities of snow; how it defined and transformed objects, reflected light, and how it softened sound. Over the years as a photographer I have continued to be captivated and inspired by the simple, transcendent, yet austere winter landscape. When I look at the collection of photographs that comprise this book, I am brought back to the places and individual experiences they represent. Some of the photographs were made in spectacularly remote places, others in profoundly ordinary locations where a confluence of elements brought about something unique and inspiring. Ultimately, these photographs are the result of my journeys and observations, and have provided an intense personal peace that I hope is felt by others. — Jeffrey Conley

"New York, 1975",Bevan Davies,false,"ISBN 978-1-59005-450-5Hardcover, Slipcased, 10.5 x 15, 48 pages, 20 duotone platesLimited edition of 350 numbered and signed copies.

“For New Yorkers, 1975 was a particularly bleak year of a tumultuous decade. The city was on the verge of insolvency, mired in a national recession and reeling from the flight of the middle class to the suburbs. Twenty percent of the public workforce was laid off while rates of crime and drug use soared. In these relentlessly frontal, clear-eyed pictures, indications of a grim reality are everywhere to be found in the form of sordid surfaces, improvised signage, cracked windows, and dissident scrawls.

When the photographs in this book were first exhibited in 1976, their formal austerity and apparently neutral stance invited comparison with the contemporaneous work of Lewis Baltz, Bernd and Hilla Becher, and other photographers featured in the seminal 'New Topographics' exhibition. Distance, however, has revealed their concerns and temperament to be more akin to those of Marville or Atget, both of whom had a special feeling for the life and death of buildings (and thus of place), or Walker Evans, whose pictures Lincoln Kirstein praised for their clear, hideous and beautiful detail, their open insanity and pitiful grandeur.’” — From the Introduction by Joshua Chuang

SHIPPING SEPTEMBER, 2017. Bevan Davies‘s second monograph in the NZ Library Series, New York, 1975 is a powerful companion book to Los Angeles, 1976 (published in NZL Set 1).

Bevan Davies’s meticulously printed photographs suggest an appreciation of this form of residential architecture with respect both to the facades on which their identities hinge and to the built spaces between those facades. Preferring to photograph during early morning hours on weekends, Davies positioned the film plane of his 8x10-inch camera parallel to the buildings’ fronts, to capture the nuanced play of shadows. The resulting images lend depth to structural and decorative elements that are simultaneously utilitarian and aesthetic. – from ‘Ed Ruscha and Some Los Angeles Apartments’ by Virginia Heckert

Los Angeles, 1976 is an exquisitely-produced collection of Bevan Davies’s photographs of Los Angeles residential architecture, a subject perfectly suited to his working methods at that time. Born in 1941 and educated at the University of Chicago during the 1960s, Bevan Davies hit his intellectual and artistic stride in the 1970s, dovetailing perfectly with the uniquely fertile grounds that Los Angeles was becoming during that decade.

The immediate impact of the work Davies produced at this time is reflected in the list of solo and group exhibitions in which his photographs was shown, including such venues as Sonnabend Gallery, New York; International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House, Rochester; The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; and Palais de Beaux Arts, Brussels.

Antigua: Photographs 1967-73,Margo Davis,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-448-2Clothbound, 12x13 inches, 72 pages, 46 duotone platesThe economy of all the Caribbean islands was determined by the transatlantic slave trade from the 15th to 19th centuries. From Cuba to Trinidad, rural island villages were homes to the stalwart African slaves who worked the sugar cane and cotton fields. Antigua, which is situated exactly at the elbow of the Caribbean island arc, is a microcosm of this history. When Margo Davis visited Antigua for the first time in July of 1967, she was struck by the faces of these villagers, and it is here that her passion for portraiture began.

When the Antiguan photographs were made, very little had changed from earlier colonial times. These stunning images have now become iconic. It is for this reason that Nazraeli Press is presenting this exquisite new monograph focusing on the people and culture of African heritage in the New World.

Antigua: Photographs 1967–1973 is an ambitious work, beautifully printed in duotone on matt art paper in an edition of 1000 copies.

Where Ravens Cry,Jakob De Boer,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-504-5Hardcover, Swiss binding, 8.5 x 11, 56 pages, 41 duotone plates.

Where Ravens Cry is based on a hauntingly soulful exploration of the mythology and mysticism of Canada’s Pacific Northwest; a visual anthropology invoking the spiritual significance of the region’s ancestral lands – and the stories and legends that were birthed from them.

Over the course of two years, de Boer immersed himself in this world through his photography, exploring its secrets, learning from its peoples, waiting patiently for the ineffable spirit of the land to reveal itself. Summoning Joseph Campbell’s notion that mythology is what unites us all, he chose a large format camera to capture isolated landscapes, desolate coastlines, massive cedar trees and sacred forests, often fusing them with motifs from the legends he encountered.

The result is an artist’s book at once restrained in its presentation, and striking in its content and message. Beautifully printed with four separate black inks on natural uncoated paper, Where Ravens Cry an exquisite limited edition production of 500 copies, individually numbered and featuring a laid-in pentaptych measuring over four feet wide when fully opened.

The artist Jakob de Boer divides his time between Toronto and Paris. His work has covered a number of subjects but ultimately comes back to one theme: the latent essence of his subject. His work has been exhibited internationally and is held in numerous collections.

San Fernando Valley,John Divola,false,"ISBN 978-1-59005-384-3Hardcover, Slipcased, 12 x 15, 60 pages, 46 duotone platesLimited edition of 350 numbered and signed copies.

San Fernando Valley is where John Divola was born and raised, and it served as both backdrop and subject for his earliest, serious photographic explorations, made during the early 1970s. This previously unpublished body of work shows “the Valley” through the eyes of a young photographer who would soon become an internationally-recognized artist with the exhibition and publication of his much more conceptual “Zuma” series.

The black and white photographs in “San Fernando Valley” comprise a series of subject groupings which, pulled together, show early manifestations of the deadpan humor and the ability to capture everyday scenes wrapped in loneliness, for which Divola is now well-known. The book is also, and not incidentally, a fascinating record of a quintessentially 1970s Los Angeles culture.

John Divola’s work is the subject of numerous books and catalogues. Widely exhibited and collected throughout the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia, Divola’s photographs are included in the permanent collections of many public and private institutions, including those of The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Getty Museum, Los Angeles; and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.",Click images to enlarge,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095219937-A5843QIIUUE7WVOXPK5F/Divola_Cvr.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1496936695662-THJ3P3JQ97CI5NFVBQ5M/NZL1_Divola_Cvr%2BSlipcase_Cvr.jpeg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095219772-8MDWOF686ZUW17VPVC42/Divola_Spreads_001.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095220356-EAVSL464P1PZ7RFR4NN9/Divola_Spreads_002.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095220788-UJAAKM5TSFHW6KM2V09B/Divola_Spreads_003.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095221952-4Z025608G2JOXE10UGST/Divola_Spreads_004.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095222148-WL9WC0O13AXV0RWAD39N/Divola_Spreads_005.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095222521-HC92F3ZS29MBNFJLG8D0/Divola_Spreads_006.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095223129-ZNV9182EKNGCEZKBW7QD/Divola_Spreads_007.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095223862-VTZ87N287317PCG941M0/Divola_Spreads_008.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095224571-T4ZG2C7T7W9MIOJCT2EV/Divola_Spreads_009.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/john-divola-san-fernando-valley
Dogs Chasing My Car in the Desert,John Divola,false,"Note to European customers: please visit our UK website: www.nazraeli.co.uk“From 1995 to 1998, I worked on a series of photographs of isolated houses in the desert at the east-end of the Morongo Valley in Southern California. As I meandered through the desert, a dog would occasionally chase my car. Sometime in 1996 I began to bring along a 35mm camera equipped with a motor drive and loaded with a fast and grainy black-and-white film. The process was simple; when I saw a dog coming toward the car I would pre-focus the camera and set the exposure. With one hand on the steering wheel, I would hold the camera out the window and expose anywhere from a few frames to a complete roll of film. I'll admit that I was not above turning around and taking a second pass in front of a house with an enthusiastic dog. Contemplating a dog chasing a car invites any number of metaphors and juxtapositions: culture and nature, the domestic and the wild, love and hate, joy and fear, the heroic and the idiotic. It could be viewed as a visceral and kinetic dance.

Isolated Houses,John Divola,false,"Note to European customers: please visit our UK website: www.nazraeli.co.ukLos Angeles is a centrifugal city, fundamentally American in its tendency toward the periphery. Isolated Houses focuses on the urban sprawl’s outer frontier. Here, 150 miles outside the city, the built environment comprises a handful of rudimentary structures, isolated cubes at the edge of the infinite plane of the desert. The dwellings that dot the landscape seem temporary and toy-like, but are the center of these photographs, the reason for their being. This work pays homage to those places where nature and culture intersect, and suggests that we all occupy a border zone between the natural and the artificial.

LA Diary,Robbert Flick,false,"*NOTE: SPECIAL EDITION ALSO AVAILABLE HERE >

Robbert Flick, born in Holland in 1939, is a Southern California artist who uses photography as his primary medium. This gorgeous new monograph presents an important, early body of work that would inform Flick’s approach to all of his subsequent artistic activities: ""The late 1960s was an open-ended time with very few boundaries. I was interested in rendering my photographic experience of Los Angeles, and wanted to emphasize the process of that experience. Rather than framing a moment, it became important to acknowledge it. This meant that the act of photographing became a gesture. I was also quite poor and had a limited amount of film. I kept some several dozen self-rolled films in a shoebox; whenever I went out I would reach in for four or five of them, and return them back into the box when exposed, leaving a snippet of leader so the film could be reused. I would have absolutely no idea what was on which film I put in my camera.

At the time I would think of film as an endless continuum, and there was a wish to acknowledge that aspect visually … the idea of multiple exposures was linked to ideas about simultaneity, the use of the “I Ching” and “there is no such thing as accident”. I photographed in this manner for a period of three years.""

One of the images on the cover of the book captures a moment from an Ortiz destruction event: where a piano filled with blood was hammered apart with an axe and subsequently a large number of mice were set free in mousetrap-filled areas on the floor. This Destruction Performance very much summarized the political conditions of the time and the senseless destruction of human life and landscapes engendered by the Vietnam war.

A Getty Scholar and Djerassi Foundation Artist-in-Residence (1989), Flick is the recipient of numerous awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship; he is a two-time recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship and was awarded a COLA Grant by the Cultural Affairs Department of the City of Los Angeles in 1999. Robbert Flick’s work is in the permanent collections of many important institutions, including The Los Angeles County Museum of Art; The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; National Museum of American Art; The Chicago Art Institute; The High Museum of Art, Atlanta; and Bibliothèque National, Paris.","Click images to enlargeISBN 978-1-59005-436-9Hardcover, Slipcased, 12 x 15, 64 pages, 29 duotone platesLimited edition of 350 numbered and signed copies.",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140399535-XEXQ7I2BMLN0C8OBZGVH/Flick_cover.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1496936812578-NK86G8UYI5U2AW0KMSEB/NZL2_Flick_Cvr%2BSlipcase_Cvr.jpeg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140405217-GB0PI4YDJ2ULDGQUM13Z/Flick_1.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140405149-BFW3IDY46T4SPQ3FV0QY/Flick_2.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140406900-L28INEW66TKXNPK0LLJQ/Flick_3.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140407854-HN4H63TRO3TAJ01V940O/Flick_4.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140409516-U6NTT9RXWCXPARRD1P9O/Flick_5.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140409881-6EIDDRSE31XQQJ2IG2HU/Flick_6.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140411621-15XMMX5VKAL3B2TLWKI8/Flick_7.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140411907-2OCMULYRVBV3UGY0PP3T/Flick_8.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/robbert-flick-la-diary-from-set-two

Lucas Foglia’s newest book and exhibition, Constant Bloom, traces the world’s longest butterfly migration, just discovered by scientists. Each year, Painted Lady butterflies travel between Africa, the Middle East, and Europe in search of blooming flowers. They have followed this route for millions of years.

Now, with climate change altering when and where wildflowers bloom, Painted Ladies rely on flowers in our parks, farms, and gardens. As Foglia followed the butterflies from Kenya to Norway, he also met people experiencing unseasonal droughts, floods, or freezes. Many were refugees traveling to Europe along the same route as the Painted Ladies.In Constant Bloom, the longest butterfly migration becomes a metaphor for connection across international borders. This beautifully printed book from Nazraeli Press gracefully explores the world and the urgent global issues of our time. With all text in English, French, and Arabic, Constant Bloom includes essays by curator Willemijn van der Zwaan and the scientists of the Worldwide Painted Lady Migration Project.View Exhibitions>Lucas Foglia, a 2024 Guggenheim Fellow, makes photographic prints that are collected and exhibited internationally at institutions including the de Young Museum, Fotomuseum Den Haag, International Center of Photography, Les Rencontres d’Arles, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Museum of Contemporary Art Denver, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and Victoria & Albert Museum.",ISBN: 978-1-59005-612-7,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/0b819ce5-0ab7-4687-bf33-b0cd6af6c1cd/00_Cover.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/bde1a391-2a08-45d8-971e-02e8675ebcf2/01.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/4ef8ea97-cccf-422d-a9e0-b4d4d569c10d/02.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/6e8b6b2a-72b9-442c-9f89-4aa1b2f92937/03.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/9e73f85d-b6a8-4ae1-ae41-542f3e200543/04.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/0897f343-bee7-4d23-9110-2fa9067939f5/05.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/ca5d123b-15c1-42f6-b52e-3f89a5cfdc5b/06.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/61453a71-809b-4806-a151-1f3724ae2a1f/07.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/7d009c89-ff84-4522-bb51-221f4e327d69/08.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/6f916192-32df-43a6-92bf-77498f0f9ea3/09.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/19a859bd-a74a-415a-bf54-fb5fe578a5b6/010.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/0fd333ca-8463-4249-b435-83c1967cede5/011.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/29ffea0d-69b8-4264-b34b-c26713778923/012.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/b8d4cdda-d471-4978-9514-15f15716f61a/013.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/855aa2e3-09e8-4aa2-8ac3-07eb626e565b/014.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/lucas-foglia-constant-bloom
Rêver Dans le Désert,Valerie Galloway,false,"NOW SHIPPING

French-born artist Valerie Galloway graduated from the University of Arizona in 1987 with a B.F.A. in photography, living in New York for many years before settling in Tucson, Arizona. Galloway’s practice includes photography, painting and mixed media, with a focus on nudes, street photography in New York and Paris, and Tucson’s Sonoran Desert.

The 32 hand-colored, toned gelatin silver photographs featured in Rêver Dans le Désert demonstrate her disparate styles: the voyeurism of Eugene Atget, the inexplicability of Man Ray, and the furtive aimlessness of the French New Wave. These images capture both fleeting French cultural references and timeless desert topographical references, each paying homage to the surrealists of the 1930s.

Rêver Dans le Désert is bound in coffee-colored silk boards with contrasting linen spine, and beautifully printed on natural textured art paper. A stunning first monograph, it is published to coincide with solo exhibitions of the artist’s work in Milan and Tokyo.

"Images, Panoramas, Sequences",David H.

Amidst a photographic community often preoccupied with the mediumʼs digital mechanics and opportunities, he cultivates the mediumʼs language of light and slowed time. Gibson would not say that he has been strongly influenced by photographyʼs pictorial tradition, but his work is rooted in that movement, especially its embrace and reinterpretation by the mid-twentieth century master Ansel Adams. Rather than mirror Adams or other practitioners of pictorialism, however, Gibson takes their language and turns it on its head. He asks us not to celebrate the beauty of the world through carefully shaped photographic renditions of it, but uses the worldʼs beauty to help us revel in the wondrous phenomenon of photography.” — From the Introduction by John Rohrbach, Senior Curator of Photographs, Amon Carter Museum of American Art

Coinciding with a major exhibition of David H. Gibsonʼs photographs at Valley House Gallery and Sculpture Garden in Dallas, Texas, this gorgeous new publication comprises three separate clothbound volumes spanning some thirty years of work. Limited to 500 hand-numbered copies and presented in a custom-made clamshell box, Images, Panoramas, Sequences is a long-overdue survey of Gibsonʼs highly-acclaimed photographic output. Working quietly and without regard to passing trends, David H. Gibson has created a body of work that celebrates the ethereal beauty of our natural world and consistently reminds us of our own place within it. As John Rohrbach sums up, “The images filling this book exude a sense of quiet solitude. I donʼt feel the need to enter his photographs, to stand there with the artist. Gibson gives me the freedom to stand there by myself and to revel in scenes that cannot be described in words.”

David H. Gibsonʼs photographs have been widely exhibited in the United States and Europe, and are housed in the permanent collections of numerous museums, including those of Amon Carter Museum, Ft. Worth; Dallas Museum of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; and Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Hundreds of Sparrows: Volume One,Katy Grannan,false,"ISBN 978-1-59005-451-2Hardcover, Slipcased, 12 x 15, 48 pages, 33 four-color platesLimited edition of 350 numbered and signed copies.

*NOTE: SPECIAL EDITION ALSO AVAILABLE HERE >

Hundreds of Sparrows is a two-volume set of books by contemporary artist and filmmaker Katy Grannan. Volume One (NZL Set 3), and Volume Two (NZL Set 4, forthcoming) both function as stand-alone books; together, they tell a deeper story, playing off of each other and delving deeper into the lives and surroundings of their subjects.

The photographs in Hundreds of Sparrows were made in the Central Valley, in particular, the sprawling cities of Modesto, Fresno, and Bakersfield that sit within this vast agricultural region in the geographical center of California. This location also served as the setting for Grannan’s debut feature film, ""The Nine"", which premiered to wide critical acclaim in 2016. Throughout the works, the artist explores the significance and complexity of the seemingly ordinary, the mundane and the overlooked—anonymous strangers, familiar gestures and interactions—the soundscape and theatre of nowhere.

This is the other side of the American Dream.

ROBERT HEINECKEN - Recto / Verso,,false,"ISBN: 1-59005-174-2Hardcover, 11 x 14 x 9 1/2, 44 pages, 24 duotone plates.

Recto/Verso is the latest attempt to grasp the magnitude of the monumental archive of photograms that Robert Heinecken created during the past 40 years. In this current sampling, comprised of work from his own archive, Heinecken offers a look back at the decade of the 1980s, where decadence and narcissism inhabit the same space as spirituality and family values. Though the patinas of these color photograms speak of that generation, their revelations are contemporary in their incisiveness. In looking at the history of the photogram, beginning with Henry Fox Talbot’s ‘photogenic drawings’ and Man Ray’s ‘Rayographs’, Heinecken must be viewed as its most rebellious practitioner – unflinching, enigmatic and alert. Robert Heinecken’s work has been widely exhibited in the United States, Europe and Asia, and is included in many major collections, including the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; LA County Museum of Art; and the Center for Creative Photography, Tucson. Recto/Verso is printed in a first edition of 1,000 casebound copies, with an introduction by Rod Slemmons, Director of the Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago.",Click images to enlarge,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1395958708478-YE782OFTRN8ZWW9Y4GA5/heinecken_cover.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1395973338786-482K1DDXOG5ADAS9S85W/heinecken_recto_spread_001.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1395973338954-9OO3OXCHN5SLM4IBDYO5/heinecken_recto_spread_002.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1395973340223-6RKS0LRIT7ZCU85B916K/heinecken_recto_spread_003.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1395973340209-M13C8TO67RRVGOA7UGYW/heinecken_recto_spread_004.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/robert-heinecken-recto-verso
"Unspeakable: The Collected Lyrics of Joe Henry, 1985–2020",,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-566-3

Hardcover, 8.5 x 11, 400 pages, 18 duotone plates.

Unspeakable: The Collected Lyrics of Joe Henry, 1985–2020, is a compilation of lyrics that, when “raised by the waters of melody,” created a body of work that established the American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer as an American creative force. The volume features lyrics to 182 songs from Henry’s fifteen albums produced between 1985 and 2020, and nineteen additional songs written for, and with, other artists, such as Roseanne Cash, Mose Allison, and Billy Bragg. The volume also includes 18 black-and-white photographs made by the artist during this same time period.

Henry moved to Brooklyn, NY, in 1985 after graduating from the University of Michigan. His first album, Talk of Heaven, was released the following year, launching what would become a steady output of work that is astonishing in both scope and influence. In addition to writing and producing his own lyrics and music, the three-time Grammy Award winner has produced albums for Bonnie Raitt, Elvis Costello, Rhiannon Giddens, and Solomon Burke, and written songs for numerous films. His work spans multiple genres, including folk, jazz, blues, and rock, yet is united by its tender tone and strikingly visual lyrics.

In the introduction, Henry notes that he began by writing poetry and then “listening just so” for the songs to reveal themselves, rendering them “wholly transformed into something that hums.” It is this poet’s heart that informs each of his lyrics, creating songs that continue to hum on the page, with or without the music.

Unspeakable: The Collected Lyrics of Joe Henry, 1985–2020 is the first title in our new ‘Nazraeli / anatol’ series of song books: collections of important and influential lyrics punctuated with original artwork made by the featured artists themselves, or by other contemporary artists.

Printed on natural matte art paper, and bound in deep green cloth with a black quarter binding, Unspeakable is published in a first edition of 1,000 copies.

A special edition of 250 copies, numbered and signed by the artist and presented in a custom cloth slipcase, is also available.

Discarded,Anthony Hernandez,false,"ISBN 978-1-59005-452-9Hardcover, Slipcased, 12 x 15, 68 pages, 35 four-color platesLimited edition of 350 numbered and signed copies.

SHIPPING SEPTEMBER, 2017. The title of Anthony Hernandez’s monograph takes its name from our collective penchant for discarding what we no longer find useful; in this case, unfinished houses and the land on which they sit, to the east and northeast of Los Angeles. The project arose from the 2008 recession, which hit California particularly hard, when homebuilders and owners faced loans and mortgages that were worth more than their properties.

Comprising 35 photographs made in desert and high desert cities such as Riverside, Salton City, Lancaster and Palmdale, Discarded opens with an essay by John Rohrbach, Senior Curator of Photography at the Amon Carter Museum where the work was first exhibited in 2016.

Of the photographs, Rohrbach writes: “Where through the 1970s and 1980s the 'New Topographics' generation led by Robert Adams and Lewis Baltz drew photographic attention to the expansion of suburbia across the open West, Anthony Hernandez now asks us to take account of the failures, the pulling back from over-exuberant expectation. Capitalism, of course, is built on optimism and growth, but just as central to its being is failure. We can’t all be winners; bust inevitably follows boom.

While some initiatives survive, others go under, abandoned to the banks and discarded to the scourges of time and happenstance. The subject offers pathos and an enticing undercurrent of violence. But where others generally embrace the romance of the struggle against the harsh climate, emphasizing isolation and self-sufficiency, Hernandez reminds us of the essentialness of community in these rough places.”

Anthony Hernandez’s photographs have been widely exhibited in the United States and Europe at such institutions as The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; The LA County Museum of Art; Sprengel Museum, Hannover; and Centre National de la Photographie, Paris. In 2016, Hernandez’s work was the subject of a major retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

Laugh from the Back,Kristin Hersh,false,"Hardcover, 8.5 x 11 inches, 72 pages, 30 four-color plates

ISBN 978-1-59005-570-0



“One of indie rock’s most fascinating figures” — The Guardian

Laugh from the Back is a collection of lyrics and images curated by American singer-songwriter Kristin Hersh, solo artist and founding member of the rock bands Throwing Muses and 50 Foot Wave. The volume features 29 photographs and 27 lyrics from Hersh’s prolific career.

The inimitable Kristin Hersh is a musician’s musician, a songwriter’s songwriter, and an innovator’s innovator. The Queen of Grunge’s first band, Throwing Muses, began recording and playing out when they were just 14 years old and they’re still going strong. 2020’s critically acclaimed Sun Racket was hailed as a “perfect record”.

Hersh’s refusal to participate in a corporate industry saw her leave a Warner Brothers recording contract at the top of her success in order to become listener-supported. “Music is humanist and so are we”, as she puts it. Wildly prolific, she has released more than 20 albums.

She’s also a celebrated author. Rolling Stone named her first book, Rat Girl, one of the ten best rock memoirs of all time. NPR said of her second book, Don’t Suck, Don’t Die (Giving Up Vic Chestnutt) “Not only one of the best books of the year, but one of the most beautiful rock memoirs ever written.” Her third, the game-changing Seeing Sideways, pushes the envelope of creative non-fiction while telling the story of raising her four sons on a tour bus.

Many of the rich and humorous images presented in Laugh from the Back reference nature and the outdoors, belying the artist’s often pained and always highly personal lyrics.

Laugh from the Back is printed in a first edition of 1,000 hand-numbered copies.

House Hunting,Todd Hido,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-505-2Hardcover, 14 x 17, 56 pages, 26 four-color plates.

“Todd Hido’s large color photographs of suburbia are lonely, forlorn, mysterious… and strangely comforting. Hido photographs the interior rooms of repossessed tract homes, and the outsides of similar houses at night whose habitation is suggested by the glow of a television set or unseen overhead bulb. Seldom does the similar evoke such melancholy. Yet rather than passing judgment on his anonymous subjects, Hido manages to turn the banal into something beautiful, imbuing his prints of interiors with soft pastels, and allowing the exteriors to glow in the cool evening air.”

— From our description of the first printing of House Hunting, announced in 2000

We are excited to announce a newly remastered edition of Todd Hido’s iconic and highly sought-after first monograph, House Hunting. To celebrate the upcoming 20th anniversary of this important book – certainly one of the most influential and oft-cited photography monographs of our time – we have collaborated closely with the artist to achieve a new impression of the highest possible fidelity. Printed on heavy weight matte art paper, using cutting-edge technologies in both the pre-press and production phases, this new edition of House Hunting stays true to the original design and format while delivering even more accurate color rendition and nuances in tone and saturation. It will be a welcome addition to collections lacking access to the very scarce original printings; and to those fortunate enough to own a copy of the original edition, it further illuminates the images themselves that first catapulted the artist and his first monograph to fame.

Todd Hido’s photographs have been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Kansas City, and most recently at the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Le Locle, Switzerland. Other major institutions that have exhibited Hido’s work include the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.; Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago; Miami Art Museum, Florida; Netherland Architecture Institute, Rotterdam; Palazzo Ducale, Genova, Italy; Samsung Museum of Modern Art in Korea; and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. His work was recently on view in the 49th edition of Les Recontres d’Arles, France.

Work by Hido is held in public and private collections including the Guggenheim Museum, New York; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Art Institute of Chicago; the Smithsonian; and Fotomuseum Winterthur.

This new edition of House Hunting is limited to 4,000 copies.

A special signed & numbered slipcased edition is also available, and is limited to 250 copies.

The End Sends Advance Warning,Todd Hido,false,"We are thrilled to announce the publication of Todd Hido's stunning new monograph, The End Sends Advance Warning.

For over 25 years, Hido has crafted narratives through loose and mysterious suburban scenes, desolate landscapes, and cinematic portraits. Irrespective of its title, this is a book about hope and beauty and why we seek it so desperately at this time. For his latest images he has roamed as far as the Hawaiian Islands and their meteorological opposites; the shores of the Bering Sea, and Nordic fjords above the Arctic Circle. Even with such geographic diversity, Hido captures places that feel at once familiar and unknown; welcoming and unsettling.

With this stunning new monograph, Hido picks up where his previous title Bright Black World left off, presenting some 80 new and previously unpublished landscape photographs. The End Sends Advance Warning is beautifully printed on heavyweight art paper and bound in offset printed linen. The book also includes 9 tipped-in photographs printed on Kasadaka art paper, as well as tipped-in and laid-in booklets. A masterpiece of an artist’s book, and a must for the serious contemporary art library.

Todd Hido’s photographs have been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Kansas City, and most recently at the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Le Locle, Switzerland. Other major institutions that have exhibited Hido’s work include the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.; Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago; Miami Art Museum, Florida; Netherland Architecture Institute, Rotterdam; Palazzo Ducale, Genova, Italy; Samsung Museum of Modern Art in Korea; and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. His work was recently on view in the 49th edition of Les Recontres d’Arles, France.

Work by Hido is held in public and private collections including the Guggenheim Museum, New York; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Art Institute of Chicago; the Smithsonian; and Fotomuseum Winterthur.

This first printing of The End Sends Advance Warning is limited to 6,000 copies.

A deluxe edition featuring an original exhibition quality photograph, presented with a copy of the book in a custom clamshell case, is also available. The deluxe edition is limited to 25 signed and numbered copies. Choice of 2 images. Image #1 >Image #2 >

Manifest Destiny,John Humble,false,"ISBN 978-1-59005-453-6Hardcover, Slipcased, 12 x 15, 56 pages, 43 four-color platesLimited edition of 350 numbered and signed copies.

*NOTE: SPECIAL EDITION ALSO AVAILABLE HERE >

Brought up in a military family, John Humble spent his childhood moving around the country from one military base to another. Humble was drafted during the Vietnam War, then became a photojournalist for the Washington Post before pursuing a graduate degree at the San Francisco Art Institute. His itinerant nature continued when he traveled the world in the early 1970s, going from Europe to the Middle East, then to Africa and Asia in his Volkswagen van. However, since the summer of 1974 Humble has lived in one place: Los Angeles.

In 1979, Humble acquired a 4x5 view camera and began to photograph the Los Angeles that he perceived every day — a Los Angeles that tourists seldom see, and that locals seldom notice. “These pictures depict the reality that the majority of people in Los Angeles experience as commonplace,” Humble writes. “The images themselves are not complex; for the most part they are quite simple, and present a set of facts which are intuitively connected by the act of putting a frame around the world. The experience of looking at one of my photographs should be similar to the experience of looking through a window.”

John Humble’s large-scale photographs have been exhibited and collected since the 1970s, and are included in the permanent collections of such institutions as the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; The LA County Museum of Art; and The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

Manifest Destiny is printed in a limited edition of 350 numbered, signed and slipcased copies.

“Focusing almost exclusively on the metropolitan landscape of Los Angeles for the past 18 years, Humble's impressive output of colour photographs does for LA by day what Brassai did for Paris by night."" — Carmine Iannoccone, Frieze

“Over the last 30 years, John Humble has photographed Los Angeles as if he were making a great, multifaceted portrait of someone he loved. His crystalline pictures find beauty, romance and empathy, as well as enchantment, surprise and delight, where you’d least expect it: in the buildings, roads and overpasses we routinely drive by. Humble’s laser-sharp prints reveal as much about the character and substance of Los Angeles as they do about his sensibility and perspective. His open-minded attitude is animated by calm curiosity, keen attentiveness and the patience to wait for those loaded moments when everything falls into place and serendipity delivers insights beyond words.” — David Pagel, L.A.

Monkey Puzzle,Yoko Ikeda,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-421-5Hardcover, 12 x 13, 52 pages, 44 four-color plates.

Neither record nor exploration, the 44 photographs in Yoko Ikeda’s Monkey Puzzle come together to form an imaginary world loosely based on commonplace, even banal, subjects. Made in locations as far-flung as Utrech, Kortrijk and Aga Town, these highly evocative images are at once ominous and inviting, uncanny in their ability to coax the unexpected from the known.

Born in Kanazawa City, Yoko Ikeda now lives and works in Tokyo. She was the 2013 recipient of the prestigious Philadelphia Museum of Art Purchase Award. Ikeda’s work has been widely exhibited in the United States and Japan. Monkey Puzzle, the artist’s first Western monograph, is richly printed on matte Japanese art paper, limited to 500 hand-numbered copies and bound in cloth.

“Photographs are sometimes referred to as as ‘fossils of light’, but it has occurred to me that Ikeda’s photographs are less like fossils, and more like precious stones.” – Kazuhiro Yamamoto, Senior Curator, Tochigi Prefectural Museum of Fine Art",Click images to enlarge,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1446077551116-ZCJ1G9J7ADC8E3MD1IFR/Ikeda_Monkey_Cvr.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1446077554772-T8DOJC8KWXOMO7WJ8LRK/Ikeda_Monkey_1.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1446077555060-QIW1UIE8H12D333UTR6P/Ikeda_Monkey_2.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1446077558698-OIRP8MBQJO1299IFTNJD/Ikeda_Monkey_3.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1446077559371-Z84YRV3AI5N8MHWZ3XV7/Ikeda_Monkey_4.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1446077559475-9M0I8OAMGYZVXDOA0YDB/Ikeda_Monkey_5.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1446077561883-L3U4SWN5UJ80L3Q9FTDV/Ikeda_Monkey_6.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1446077560995-MOR99QFDK7O9T7OG5SFW/Ikeda_Monkey_7.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1446077562874-1Q53BPC523VM0NMBKLGM/Ikeda_Monkey_8.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/yoko-ikeda-monkey-puzzle

“Noh is a form of theatre in which the soul expresses pride and the way a person lived and died. It is performed with music, singing and dancing to create a sense of realism. It depicts both the glory and loneliness of life, and the salvation of the gods and Buddhas.” — Hirotada Kasannoin, Chief Priest of Kasuga TaishaWe are pleased to announce the publication of Mono No Aware by Japanese photographer Kenro Izu. Born in Osaka, Japan, Izu moved to New York at the age of 21, opening Kenro Izu Studio in 1974. For fifty years, Izu has photographed sacred spaces around the world and has examined the “inner sacredness” within his subjects.

In Mono No Aware: The Beauty of Impermanence, Izu explores three subjects: 14th-century Noh masks from the Nohgaku Museum in Kanazawa, Japan; the stones and “giant trees of a sacred class” that surround the remains of ancient shrines that were built as Noh stages; and the briefly blooming wildflowers and grasses found near his home.

The phrase “Mono No Aware” translates to “the pathos of things” and reflects a Japanese concept recognizing the impermanence of life and expressing an appreciation of the fleeting beauty of ephemeral objects. In some 100 images, Izu examines this concept in three themes: Yugen (profundity), Sabi (beauty with aging), and Wabi (austere beauty), each speaking to “the beauty of impermanence” found in his subjects.

Mono No Aware is printed in duotone on natural matte art paper and bound in linen over boards, presented in 2 volumes housed in a custom slipcase. It includes essays by Kenro Izu, Kaoru Nakanish (Director of the Sasayama Nohgaku Museum), and Hirotada Kasannoin (Chief Priest of Kasuga Taisha).

The Hollywood Suites,Steve Kahn,false,"ISBN 978-1-59005-385-0Hardcover, Slipcased, 12 x 15, 56 pages, 51 duotone platesLimited edition of 350 numbered and signed copies.*NOTE: SPECIAL EDITION ALSO AVAILABLE HERE >

The images in Steve Kahn’s enigmatic The Hollywood Suites were all made in run-down apartments between the years 1974 and 1976. Alternately provocative and haunting, they were the subject of solo exhibitions on the West Coast and in Europe during that decade and included in noted group exhibitions such as Exposing: Photographic Definitions at the Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art in 1976 and The Altered Photograph at P.S. 1 in New York in 1979.

The series divides into two groups of pictures. The Hollywood Suites (nudes) features sexually charged pictures of young women, often partially clad and sometimes cropped. In The Hollywood Suites (mirrors, windows and doors), Kahn concentrated on architectural interiors, making arresting use of windows and doors. The images themselves are grainy and offer an unnaturally sharp contrast between darks and lights. Select examples feature doorways embellished with geometric patterns done in twine.

Kahn, who was born in 1943, was part of an important generation of Los Angeles photographers that included Robert Heinecken, Ilene Segalove and Jerry McMillan, among others. They brought a conceptual and collage approach to the picture. Many were chronicled in the important exhibition at the Laguna Art Museum, ""Proof: Los Angeles and the Photograph: 1960-1980"". Kahn's work is also included the 2011 book, L.A. Rising: SoCal Artists Before 1980.

Steve Kahn’s work is included in the permanent collections of institutions across the United States and Europe, including those of the LA County Museum of Art; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Museum of Modern Art, Toulon, France; and De Beyerd Museum; Breda, Holland.

Can You Hear the Wind Blow,Kim Jungman,false,"NOW SHIPPING

ISBN: 978-1-59005-500-7Hardcover, 10 x 14, 80 pages, 62 duotone plates. Nazraeli Press is thrilled to announce the publication of Kim Jungman’s Can You Hear the Wind Blow. This gorgeous series of large format photographs illustrates the sound of wind, made visible by the subtlest movements of tree branches, leaves, and a seemingly endless number of birds in flight and at rest.Comprising 62 photographs, Can You Hear the Wind Blow beckons the viewer into what appears to be a wide-open forest of single trees, each with enough space to move freely in the wind. The trees are portrayed as stoic individuals, at once deeply rooted and flexible, planted at an unknown time in an unknown paradise. In actual fact, all of the photographs in the book were made between 2008 and 2017, and simply depict a row of neglected street trees in an alley between the artist’s studio and home in Seoul.One of his country’s most important contemporary artists, Kim Jungman was born in Cheolwon, South Korea in 1954. He moved as a teenager to Burkina Faso, Africa and then to Europe, studying painting École Nationale Supérieure d’Art at Villa Arson in Nice, France. It was there that he discovered his passion for photography. He moved back to Seoul and soon gained fame for his edgy, often controversial work as the country’s premier commercial and fashion photographer.In 2006, Jungman Kim left his flourishing career as a commercial photographer to pursue his personal work, photographing the countryside of his native country. Can You Hear the Wind Blow was published to accompany a major exhibition of the work at The Hanmi Museum of Photography, Seoul and Three Shadows Gallery in Beijing.A Special Edition of the book is now available, at $1,500. This edition comprises a copy of Can You Hear the Wind Blow, and one unique print from the book - choice is on a first-come, first-served basis - presented in a custom-made clamshell box.

Japan | A Love Story,Michael Kenna,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-599-1Hardcover, cloth, 10.5 x 13 inches, 136 pages, 100 plates.

Published to coincide with a major 2024 traveling exhibition in Tokyo, Los Angeles and London, this gorgeous new monograph presents 100 of Michael Kenna’s most iconic photographs of the Japanese landscape, many published here for the first time. A perfect pairing of artist and subject, these photographs of Japan comprise perhaps Kenna’s best known body of work and have been the subject of countless exhibitions throughout the world. Michael Kenna first visited Japan in 1987 on the event of his inaugural exhibition there, and he has returned dozens of times and made thousands of photographs throughout the country’s vast and incredibly varied landscape. Our earlier monographs Japan and Hokkaido have been out of print for many years, so we are thrilled to announce this important new publication that includes work spanning Kenna’s decades-long love affair with the country. Japan / A Love Story is beautifully printed in duotone on natural coated art paper and quarter bound in linen and silk. It opens with an essay in Japanese and English by the renowned critic and historian Kohtaro Iizawa. “Japan has a long and rich tradition of reciprocal gift giving. I have been the grateful recipient of so much over so many years in Japan, and I know that I will never be able to give back in equal measure. I hope this work can be seen as a small token of my desire to do so. I also hope this work can be viewed as a homage to Japan and that it will serve to symbolize my immense ongoing appreciation and deep gratitude for this beautiful and mysterious country.” — From the Afterword by Michael Kenna ""He has been reflective when others have been militant, romantic when others have been skeptical. Such isolation can starve all but the most independent of talents, but for these it can provide a sanctuary where visions can develop undisturbed. Kenna is one of these.” — Joanna Pitman, The Times

ISBN: 978-1-59005-544-1Hardcover, cloth, 10 x 13 inches, 96 pages, 75 plates.

“This book is an early vignette from Michael Kenna’s far-reaching photographic odyssey. Some of these photographs, made almost forty years ago, are familiar, even famous, but many have never been seen before. They have been lying in wait, stored in a series of negative files. Normally, Kenna travels extensively and is not able to keep up with printing his extensive collection of negatives. It took the Covid pandemic and lockdown for him to search through his archives, rediscover these long-forgotten images, and print them in his darkroom. These photographs reveal a Northern England from Kenna’s youth that, for the most part, no longer exists.” — From the Introduction

Michael Kenna was born in the small industrial town of Widnes in northwest England. The youngest of six children, Kenna grew up in a poor, working-class, Irish-Catholic family. He attended a seminary school for seven years with the intention of becoming a priest, after which he studied at the Banbury School of Art and later at the London College of Printing, before moving to the USA in the late seventies.

The adjoining counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire, where Kenna photographed in the early eighties, have much in common regarding their industrial development. Fiercely competitive, they share a border, a spine of mountains known locally as the Pennines, which helps to produce rain. The rise of a powerful cotton and wool industry, and the building of innumerable mills, canals, railways, chimneys and terraced worker houses, have been attributed in part to these high levels of precipitation. The local textile industry proliferated until the second half of the twentieth century, when there was a sudden, rapid decline and eventual decimation. It was during this precise time period that Kenna returned to the area to photograph, during the day and also at night.

Kenna’s early photographs of England launched his career and brought him international acclaim; yet it wasn’t until last year, 2020, that he revisited this particular body of work to find many unprinted images. These discoveries are exquisitely presented in this important new Nazraeli Press monograph, Northern England 1983–1986.

Beautifully printed on a natural textured art paper, accompanied by an introductory text by Dr. Ian B Glover, the seventy-five plates are reproduced in quadratone and bound into cotton cloth-covered boards reminiscent of the era.

Photographs and Stories (BACK IN PRINT!),Michael Kenna,false,"NOW SHIPPING

In celebration of Michael Kenna’s fiftieth year as a photographer, we are thrilled to announce the publication ofMichael Kenna: Photographs and Stories. This gorgeous monograph, beautifully printed on Japanese Kasadaka paper and bound in custom deep blue cloth, is published in association with the Center for Photographic Art to coincide with a traveling exhibition opening at their historic Carmel, California exhibition space in November 2023.

Kenna has selected one image for each year beginning 1973, when he enrolled in the Banbury School of Art, and for each subsequent year. Following the “Photographs” section is “Stories,” in which Kenna gives context to each image and considers how it connected to his own life at the time.

Michael Kenna is arguably the most influential landscape photographer of his generation. Often working at dawn or during the night, he has concentrated primarily on the interaction between the ephemeral atmospheric conditions of the natural landscape, and human-made structures and sculptural mass. Over ninety books and catalogs have been published on his work. His exquisite, hand crafted, silver gelatin prints have been exhibited throughout the world and are included in such permanent museum collections as The National Gallery, Washington, D.C.; The Shanghai Art Museum, Shanghai; and The Victoria and Albert Museum, London. In 2022, Mr. Kenna was made an Officer in the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Ministry of Culture.

“This book is a journey, navigating places foreign and familiar, winding through black and white scenes full of spacious calm. It is a great pleasure to look at these images, to feel that maybe everything is going to be all right after all, that the world isn’t such a bad place, and magic still exists. There is a reassuring quality to these photographs, and I, for one, am grateful for Michael Kenna’s half century of watching the light and recording his vision.”— From the Introduction by Ann Jastrab

This second printing is limited to 3,000 copies.

Rafu,Michael Kenna,false,"NOW SHIPPING

ISBN: 978-1-59005-498-7Hardcover, 8 x 12, 64 pages, 41 duotone plates.

For over thirty years, Michael Kenna has photographed temples, shrines, gardens, seascapes and landscapes, in black and white, throughout Japan. Ten years ago, he also began to photograph female nudes in various locations in Japan. A selection of these photographs was unveiled to the public for the first time at Paris Photo in November 2018.

The Japanese women who modeled were actresses, dancers, office workers, photographers and yoga practitioners. “Their willingness to express themselves in front of the camera and their trust in my integrity as a photographer, enabled us to engage in creative visual explorations and conversations”, says Kenna. “The human body is an absolutely amazing, mysterious miracle in a myriad of ways”, adds the British photographer. “I view both historical and contemporary creative representations of the nude as open invitations to explore this esthetic challenge. My efforts may add little or nothing to the enormous existing mountain of artistic treasures, but that is not important. This is another chapter in an ongoing story”.

Nazraeli Press is pleased to announce the publication of Kenna’s Japanese nude studies, entitled Rafu. Beautifully printed on uncoated Japanese art paper, and hand-bound in deep purple silk, this gorgeous artist’s book presents 42 images from the Rafu series. The first printing is limited to 1,000 copies. A special slipcased edition, individually numbered and signed by the artist, is available here > A deluxe edition of 25 copies, including a gelatin silver print made by the artist and presented with a copy of the book in a custom clamshell box, is available here >

Rafu was published to coincide with a major retrospective exhibition of Michael Kenna’s photographic work at the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photographic Art.

RATCLIFFE POWER STATION,Michael Kenna,false,"Hardcover, 12 x 13, 64 pages, 49 duotone plates

Michael Kenna first began photographing the Ratcliffe power station in the early 1980s, and over the past several years he has visited the site many times, producing a body of work as ominous as it is beautiful. The Ratcliffe photographs take on the tonal quality of a partially lit ecosphere unique to the photographer and his subject. A brilliant manipulator of half-light, Kenna's grainy, spatial topography epitomizes the gray skies of Northern England that were the ubiquitous backdrop to his childhood. Kenna's Ratcliffe photographs create the impression of an atmospherically foggy day, registering the homeostasis of a mood that is a dominant characteristic of his work. Beautifully printed in duotone on matt art paper, Ratcliffe Power Station is published in a first edition of 3,000 copies.

Music | Text,Idris Khan: Image,false,"ISBN 978-1-59005-386-7Hardcover, Slipcased, 12 x 15, 72 pages, 29 duotone platesLimited edition of 350 numbered and signed copies.

London-based artist Idris Khan was born in the UK in 1978. Since completing his Master’s Degree with a Distinction in Research at the Royal College of Art in London in 2004, Khan has received international acclaim for his minimal, yet emotionally charged photographs, videos and sculptures and is without question one of the most exciting British artists of his generation.

Appropriating icons of literature, music, and art, Khan methodically layers his material, whether it is Beethoven’s symphony, Milton’s Paradise Lost, or Bernd and Hilla Becher’s stylized sculpture of water towers. In speaking about his work, Khan says that “every layer is an effect that needs to be created... Each layer is a fallible human decision. There is a decision made as to what I want to keep and what has to disappear. This process allows me to cut out the camera completely.” Each layer in the resulting artwork adds complexity similar to a painter’s mark on a canvas. Khan’s photographs are not “taken”; they are built. The final composite image has the look and feel of a dense, quivering charcoal drawing.

Image | Music | Text presents a selection of Khan’s most powerful imagery to date, enjoying the intimacy of a book’s presentation while taking full advantage of the series’s generous format. The artist’s design incorporates three gatefold spreads, each measuring some thirty inches across.

Tsugaru | Shimokita,Kazuo Kitai,false,"ISBN 978-1-59005-437-6Hardcover, Slipcased, 12 x 15, 48 pages, 40 duotone platesLimited edition of 350 numbered and signed copies.

Kazuo Kitai dropped out six months into his first year of art school, revealing a rebellious streak that led him to become involved in the protest movements of 1960s Japan. His first photography book, “Resistance”, was self-published in 1965. For the rest of the 1960s he continued to follow radical student protests, producing Barricade, Agitators and finally Sanrizuka in 1971. As the 1960s came to a close, Kitai became disillusioned with political themes and turned to the everyday life of ordinary people. Kitai`s first journey was to one of the most remote parts of Japan, the Shimokita Peninsula, and photographs from this journey to Shimokita in 1970 make up the first half of this book. In 1972 and 1973 Kitai traveled again to this most northerly part of Honshu, to the neighboring area of Tsugaru, and this makes up the other half of this book. These regions of Shimokita and Tsugaru had been very isolated and barren, with bitterly cold winters. Local language, legends and ancient beliefs had survived into the modern era. The region was known for shamanism and communion with the dead spirits gathering around the holy mountain of Osorezan. During the rest of the 1970s, Kitai was to continue his exploration of rural areas of Japan, for which, in 1976, he received the award of the inaugural Ihei Kimura Prize, Japan`s most prestigious award for photography. Kazuo Kitai was born in Manchuria in 1944. He began photographing in the mid-1960s and remains active 50 years later. He is best known for his protest photography of the 1960s and his work on rural Japan in the1970s. In the 1980s, he concerned himself with the citizens of Osaka and Tokyo (Shinsekai Monogatari, Funabashi Story). Recent years have seen him publish a regular column in Nippon Camera magazine (”Walking with Leica”) as well as a rise of public interest in his work both in Japan and overseas.",Click images to enlarge,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140652212-BJ2JOALHKCB9RP2B8BT3/kitai_cover1.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1496936830912-MW6LTRQXTS4A988BV04U/NZL2_Kitai_Cvr%2BSlipcase_Cvr.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140684959-RIG0QX0OEH7B1CAVI0IS/Kitai_1.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140687183-Z85SZE3S0NJW8Z4KA0RJ/Kitai_2.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140685774-TZN1JZ6SIRHEJAUD88G9/Kitai_3.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140686554-BP2LVO2OZN460I3T346V/Kitai_4.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140687482-G1CQG1Y5CF8M1O6Z3F4E/Kitai_5.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140688620-U9ZIOKVDNIJOVG6BOYNE/Kitai_6.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1457140688761-AWMBZD1WZYAU67XRFHOI/Kitai_7.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/kazuo-kitai-tsugaru-shimokita-from-set-two
California,Bob Kolbrener,false,"Hardcover, 10 x 12.5, 78 pages, 59 duotone plates.

“Kolbrener stands apart because his photographs have a rare technical perfection — every print is ideal and masterful in light, tone, cropping and consistency.” — James D. Burke, Director, Saint Louis Art Museum

A native of Missouri, American artist Bob Kolbrener was born in 1942 and began his career in St. Louis. He established a commercial photography business there in 1969 that was structured to give him and his wife, Sharon, time to photograph the American West. “We would work for five months and then head out for a month of fine art photography…living as nomads for two months of the year for over thirty years,” said Kolbrener. A life-long devotion to California landscapes began when he saw six large-format Ansel Adams photographs in a gallery in Yosemite National Park in 1968. A transformational experience, it resulted in Kolbrener meeting, studying under, and ultimately working with Adams throughout the 1970s as he continued to build his own reputation as a superb landscape photographer.

Kolbrener’s technical method, which remains grounded in the “old fashioned way,” as the artist describes it, uses fiber-based paper, tray processing and selenium toner. His photographs are made on film, using large format cameras. He does not enhance or photo-edit his work. Kolbrener “introduced audiences to ‘straight photography,’ and his black-and-white images have given viewers the magical experience of seeing unparalleled beauty that does not depend on manipulation or special effects,” writes curator Gary F. Kurutz in his introductory essay.

Kolbrener’s photographs have been exhibited in museums, art galleries and libraries across the country and in Austria, Great Britain, China, Indonesia, and Japan. His images are in collections at the Saint Louis Art Museum, Monterey Museum of Art, High Museum of Art, and Washington University. In 2019, following a retrospective of his work, the Booth Museum acquired nearly two dozen of his works for their permanent collection. The Kolbreners moved to the Monterey Peninsula in 1996, closer to the iconic western landscapes that define his work.

Published by Nazraeli Press in 2022, California features 60 plates of black-and-white photographs taken between 1968 and 2019. This first edition is limited to 1,000 copies.

A deluxe edition featuring an original silver gelatin photograph, hand-printed by the artist and presented in a custom clamshell box, is also available in a limited edition of 25 copies.",ISBN: 978-1-59005-568-7,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1656437517385-UYI2BU7NYSG7E5RM48U0/California_0_Cvr.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657232676881-XI6RHVZAW71SB742Z69I/California_01.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657232677237-YJ1OG9ZANVPIDQEYY207/California_02.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657232678759-YK3YOAEMT1UFM106F89N/California_03.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657232678759-RBVIHQJF1U6RBOLVQPTO/California_04.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657232678442-VQBB5PLYZY2QVOR33I84/California_05.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657232693936-34CMFGKH0EEUVPJBLRI6/California_06.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657232697057-S0G39W964P7WVLP0WSQC/California_07.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657232696590-6GARTMGBRDHX0M3SN460/California_08.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657232697145-GQWGVDZ8B2AT5RSPC7E7/California_09.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657232697123-KH3B26WMTRWS8FWL5P90/California_10.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657232711834-OV96DEVYNTX5KFYWT707/California_11.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657232719685-SHFEEFYMWD749XM2UOIU/California_12.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657232719663-91LKL5TLSZJUOE1R67RE/California_13.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657232719080-CX9BXB06DLXPOL1Z64B4/California_14.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657232717731-QFCBAXD853AD0RNO562K/California_15.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657233199890-NRZ3G2G7FNNUUD7Q9RE6/California_16a.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657233200384-P0VW9YGO3O45IM9NKNH4/California_16b.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1657232717767-19RJ7MN6VTPAOPEKNB0E/California_17.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/bob-kolbrener-california

“In my opinion, Bob Kolbrener is the most brilliant California landscape photographer since Ansel Adams.”— Gary F. Kurutz, Curator Emeritus of Special Collections, California State Library

Our second monograph on the work of Bob Kolbrener presents a selection of his large-scale black and white photographs of the American West. A companion book to his critically acclaimed monograph California published by Nazraeli Press in 2021, Sky Country comprises over 50 of Kolbrener’s most powerful works, many published here for the first time. An established US photographic artist, Bob Kolbrener (b.1942) was inspired, then protégé, then a colleague to the great landscape maestro Ansel Adams, and is himself now one of the USA's most distinguished contemporary black and white photographers of its incredible vistas. His work shows the essence of the Great American West, the cathedral-like Yosemite National park, and seascapes of California's churning Pacific coastline. Printed in duotone on special matte-coated art paper, and bound in linen with a tipped-in cover plate, Sky Country opens with an introduction by Ann Jastrab. It is published on the occasion of Kolbrener’s solo exhibition at Center for Photographic Art, Carmel opening in February, 2025. “There’s a moment, when you have a choice, to look back or go forward, and you take a step away from the familiar, towards the edge, to the wide open space, clouds among clouds among clouds. And at first, it’s like an Alfred Steiglitz sky and then it’s something grander, like a Thomas Cole painting, but then, no, it’s not the East anymore. It’s the wide open expanse of the West. A sky that is something Larry McMurtry’s characters only dreamed of seeing when they were crossing the parched land of West Texas. Clouds of vastness, plains of dreams, hills like stories, really, like a story from Wright Morris when he put down his camera and picked up his pen and described what he saw and what couldn’t be seen. Bob Kolbrener is from a similar part of the country, Missouri, much like the canvas of Nebraska, of the plains, of the fields. It’s not just Wright Morris, but it’s Willa Cather’s voice I hear across the distance, calling. Maybe Kolbrener read their passages too, saw the weather coming from the West, grew restless waiting for its arrival while standing beneath the Gateway to the West in his hometown of St. Louis. The wind couldn’t bring him the clouds fast enough and he had to go. He was ready, his camera was ready, sublime film negatives printed as breathtaking silver prints. And though photographers before him documented the land, for him it was the sky. For Bob Kolbrener’s West is not anyone else’s West. I imagine him, miles from anyone, no lights in the distance, no light anywhere save what he is letting in through his lens.” — From the Introduction by Ann Jastrab, Executive Director, Center for Photographic Art, Carmel.

Pictorial Zoology,Laszlo Layton,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-355-3Hardcover, 11 x 14, 60 pages, 58 color plates.

NOW SHIPPING. Laszlo Layton’s artwork comprises modern images that evoke 18th and 19th century natural history drawings. To create his work, Layton first photographs a museum specimen using a restored 11x14-inch mahogany Deardoff camera, fitted with vintage Pinkham & Smith lenses. After making a cyanotype of the image, Layton then painstakingly hand paints the resulting print in subtle hues of color. Each print in the edition is therefore unique, and as much an object as a photographic print. Layton’s work makes obvious reference to naturalist John James Audubon and his majestic illustrations in Birds of America. However, his photographs owe as much to John Ruskin and the Arts and Crafts movement’s emphasis on naturalism and craftsmanship. Although Layton’s work operates at the intersection of science and art, it is a call to beauty, not a diagram of reality. Laszlo Layton’s work is widely exhibited and collected. It is included in such permanent collections as The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art; The L.A. County Museum of Art; and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Pictorial Zoology is his first monograph. It is printed on lush Japanese art paper in an oversized, 11x14-inch format allowing the original artworks to be reproduced at full scale.

LeBlanc's publications have earned a presence in global institutions, including the Museum of Modern Art PS1, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Frye Art Museum, and the Getty Museum's Research Institute Library.",ISBN: 978-1-59005-615-8,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/68dc05d1-524b-4815-b8dc-226bca7bc5f2/Tin+Lizards.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/ff32fcc8-e5b5-4d65-beef-1f85dc740470/01.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/c63ac51f-cf62-495c-8f15-22a01f651578/02.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/2dc77341-1f24-4558-84d6-f5a96d3e28a8/03.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/e8e1ede8-2f13-4522-9238-3957e24f598d/04.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/01b162c1-7919-4028-91e4-da9e8cf150b5/05.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/e2a6502f-a6be-4f56-bd99-3442b0c6f44b/06.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/c12696e6-4df8-4c67-a246-fddc4fd3cfda/07.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1f7a820c-b524-44c2-b1cc-14b70766dc55/08.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/e108beac-be70-4617-9c8a-7ba6790009a4/09.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/25ec6995-96a0-42d6-8476-1ecc9694da0f/10.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/a0ae4525-462c-4e6b-86b1-6fdc2eab74ba/11.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/e4f77550-966e-47dc-b4d4-e5c404b7298a/12.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/daf99daa-8b05-47a3-b03c-0d57dfcd6f11/13.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/62f9f356-8084-4bed-8ab5-738d2526aa7d/14.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/robert-leblanc-tin-lizards
Voice,Jungjin Lee,false,"Jungjin Lee’s extraordinary new artist’s book, Voice, comprises 46 large-scale photographs made in 2018 and 2019. While the photographs were originally made in deserts, mountains, oceans and plains, the artist writes, “My images should be seen as metaphors, a form of meditation. I do not depict landscapes or nature. The desert allows me to see my inner self, and my goal is to make images of what I feel there: the eternal sense of being open and present to the world.”

Lee’s work has expanded the boundaries of the photographic process to create images that are simultaneously textural and minimalist. After printing an image on hand-emulsified cotton or mulberry paper, she then alters its finish, using technological processes that result in a distinct, high contrast image.

Born in Korea in 1961, Lee began photographing while a student at Hongik University in Seoul, where she earned a BFA in ceramics in 1984. After graduating, Lee worked as a photo journalist and freelance photographer. She earned an MA in Photography from New York University in 1991. While in New York City, Lee worked for the photographer Robert Frank. Later, she traveled across the country and was deeply moved by the American desert, which became the subject of several of her photographic series.

Lee’s work has been exhibited widely and is in countless collections, including the The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, LA County Museum of Art, Houston Museum of Fine Arts, the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Gwacheon, Korea, the Seoul Museum of Art, and the Goeun Museum of Photography in Busan, Korea. Her work has been the subject of numerous publications; Voice is the Jungjin Lee’s third monograph with Nazraeli Press.

A deluxe edition featuring an original exhibition quality photograph, presented with a copy of the book in a custom clamshell case, is also available.

Mission San Miguel Arcángel,Melba Levick,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-511-3Hardcover, 3-panel binding, 8.5 x 11, 68 pages, 41 four-color plates.

Mission San Miguel Arcángel was founded on July 25, 1797 in what is now California’s Central Coast. The site was chosen in part because of the large number of Salinan Indians that inhabited the area, whom the Spanish priests wanted to evangelize.

Unlike most of the other missions in California, Mission San Miguel's appearance is much the same as it was when founded. The inside has never been repainted; the pictures and the colors decorating the six-food thick adobe walls are the originals that were created and painted by Indian artisans under the direction of Esteban Munras of Catalonia, Spain.

The physical beauty of the structures and gardens is unparalleled, but among California’s twenty-one Spanish missions, San Miguel is in many ways considered to be the “poor stepson” of the chain, and has until now been lacking a dedicated book. Further, it is only a short distance from Nazraeli Press’ editorial office and olive farm. We are therefore especially pleased to announce this book, dedicated to the history and present state Mission San Miguel.

The gorgeous photographs comprising the main section of the book were made by renowned architectural and travel photographer Melba Levick. Levick made numerous trips to California’s Central Coast to photograph Mission San Miguel for this book and for posterity. The breathtakingly beautiful exterior views of the chapel and surrounding structures are interwoven with more intimate photographs of architectural details and design elements.

The book opens with an enlightening essay by Professor Rubén G. Mendoza, exploring the history of the missions and offering a glimpse into life in the Mission when it was first established. Dr. Mendoza is an archaeologist, writer, photographer, founding faculty, and SBGS Division Chair at the California State University, Monterey Bay.

With over 50 photographic books to her credit, Melba Levick is well known for her work as an architectural and travel photographer. Her photographs have been published and exhibited across North America and Europe for over thirty years, ranging in subject matter from California ranches and Spanish-style homes, to Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona, Mexican gardens, and the colors of India.

Mission San Miguel Arcángel is beautifully printed on special uncoated art paper and housed in a 3-panel cover of oxblood colored cloth. A beautiful object in its own right, this book will be an important addition to the literature already available on California’s missions, while serving as an invaluable resource to architects, archaeologists and historians.",Click images to enlarge,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573442804629-3S0YTYRQKJGBS5VD8NX4/Levick_0_Cvr.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573442804830-VZH5GRORPPWNQH4Y2AUT/Levick_1.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573442806737-K30GGFDP0OIF944SPTCM/Levick_2.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573442806938-GA1ZLLEELG5IYW9U2OVQ/Levick_3.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573442808269-Z6VWDKJYVCKJ2ANWKBFU/Levick_4.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573442809360-K6BQ4YHJF9X2VZBKK191/Levick_5.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573442809915-IUC4IEHQ08576TQYC0G1/Levick_6.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573442810975-KW4D5GRGV0936QE544NC/Levick_7.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573442811952-1LC89O5PXDCLDLYY5SYN/Levick_8.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573442812448-J294MLGBMJR49C60E4LL/Levick_9.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573442815074-OIS1SEWX3Z3LEQMH6X1A/Levick_10.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573442815856-2U73DM4B3SJ12W91XL0T/Levick_11.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573442818482-RR5VBAGQN0BL9BPG5WYV/Levick_12.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573442818728-FM1K5CTIH0ZFDP9I1VQD/Levick_13.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573442819894-MTUD3QF4CRT8QTFE731X/Levick_14.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/melba-levick-mission-san-miguel-arcngel
Central Park New York,Jeff Liao,false,"Hardcover, 9 x 15 inches, 60 pages, 24 duotone plates

Time is not bound by culture, and neither is nature. In order to comprehend and appreciate all aspects of Central Park, Jeff Liao followed the Chinese 24 Solar Terms timetable to document the micro changes that happen in this phenomenal “man-made nature”. By adapting the vertical format and multiple perspectives of traditional Chinese landscape paintings, these photographs capture the life and activities that occur within the shifting landscape of the “lung of Manhattan”.

The connection that visitors make with Central Park’s original intent as a scenic retreat from urban life has never been more real than it is today. Jeff Liao’s work in 24 Solar Terms is a perfect example of that experience of nature and design: a unique interpretation of the Park’s views and attention to the subtleties of some of its most intimate corners. The photographs show the Park at its most beautiful and cared for, a true celebration of Conservancy’s dedication and hard work.

Jeff Chien-Hsing Liao was born in Taiwan in 1977 and, in 1999 emigrated to the United States, residing in the Queens Borough of New York City. He lived in close proximity of the 7-subway line, where he created his renowned “Habitat 7” series and staked his claim and love for New York City. Liao’s work can be found in the permanent collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Queens Museum, New York; Brooklyn Museum, New York; J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; George Eastman House, Rochester, New York; and the Norton Museum of Art, Pasadena.

“The necessity of maintaining the delicate balance between man and nature, art and discovery, so clearly understood by Olmsted and Vaux over 150 years ago, has been tested to the near-ruin of Central Park, and our ability to educate visitors about that chapter in the Park’s history is a critical part of ensuring its survival. Our mandate as New Yorkers and as lovers of Central Park is clear: We can never take Central Park for granted and it can never be allowed to go back to the decline it had fallen into previously. Work like Jeff’s, that celebrates the Park at its best, can only help in keeping this jewel of New York City a place of wonder and respite for every person who enters.” — Douglas Blonsky, President & CEO, Central Park Conservancy and Central Park Administrator

Proverbs,Gregori Maiofis,false,"*DELUXE EDITION WITH PRINT AVAILABLE HERE >

ISBN: 978-1-59005-396-6Hardcover, 11 x 14, 52 pages, 26 duotone plates.

Gregori Maiofis’ work has been influenced by multinational and multicultural concerns as well as his own genetic history. He comes from a family of artists and architects, and he grew up in St. Petersburg, a sophisticated city that is considered the capital of classical museum style. After a brief stint in Los Angeles, during which time he learned new art forms and honed his English language skills, Maiofis returned to his native St. Petersburg, because, as he states, “I can do things here artistically that I couldn’t do anywhere else.”Proverbs is an ongoing series of photographs in which the artist focuses on universal truths. Using trained circus animals in many of his images – from a gargantuan brown bear to monkeys, dogs, lions and most recently, elephants – in settings absent of artifacts or other cultural information, Maiofis offers visually poignant, strike to the heart-of-the-matter images. (His latest work, Closed Mouth Catches No Flies, was an image that Maiofis had visualized very early on, but it wasn’t until years later that he finally met a lion tamer who, as part of his performance, actually puts his head in the mouth of a lion.)

Maiofis’ work has has been the subject of solo exhibitions across Russia, Europe, and the United States. His work is included in the permanent collections in many museums, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Moscow Museum of Modern Art, the Novy Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia and the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, California.",Click images to enlarge,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1410974022175-IPTIPDX7G2TA5WWPQ2LN/Maiofis_Proverbs_Cover_Black.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1410974023273-W559IMGEMPFWKCX4CXFR/Maiofis_Proverbs_Cover_Red.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1410974023707-HDVG6J5OBTU1EYS8IRDO/Maiofis_Proverbs_Spread_002.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1410974025139-GB6CZUBYALOX954DAQ26/Maiofis_Proverbs_Spread_003.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1410974024505-UHAD0QZIIH7AU91Z335R/Maiofis_Proverbs_Spread_004.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1410974027359-M7SM6K2H3JKFIG7OJRX1/Maiofis_Proverbs_Spread_005.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1410974025912-NGJYC1XHMMC2O58XFXXI/Maiofis_Proverbs_Spread_006.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1410974030357-ET5438OUEPT9CV095ORS/Maiofis_Proverbs_Spread_007.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1410974028934-ZOXSO8S1KRCLOVNWIFT3/Maiofis_Proverbs_Spread_008.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1410974030323-UK2N0WA7YFR2KIRQFGU3/Maiofis_Proverbs_Spread_009.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/gregori-maiofis-proverbs
WORKSHOP: The Book as Medium with Tanya Marcuse,,false,"Have you ever experienced making a photobook?

Inspired by the tradition of live bookmaking performances (like Daido Moriyama’s 1974 Printing Show), this four-hour workshop offers the unique, unusual, immersive opportunity for participants to work in close dialogue with the artist as together they translate her photographic project into book form.

Centered on Marcuse’s very newest body of work, Canto XIII—inspired by Dante’s Divine Comedy—this hands-on workshop invites participants to engage directly in key editorial and conceptual decisions.

Working with Tanya Marcuse, participants explore how the book functions as a unique expressive medium, shaping meaning through sequencing, scale, layout, and the relationship between image and text. Through collective editing and discussion, the group considers how book form can articulate the underlying conceptual and expressive foundations of a project.

The book will be published in Summer 2026 by Nazraeli Press in a very limited edition of 500 copies. Each participant will receive a copy of the special edition with print (value: $500 / only 20 available).

The workshop is limited to only 8 participants.



cost: $350 – includes a copy of the special edition and access to SHOW LA

participants will receive material prior to the workshop

when: Friday, February 27, from 10am to 2pm

where: Daido Star Space, The Reef, 12th floor



Biography

Tanya Marcuse (b. 1964) is an American photographer most known for her large-scale photographs that explore the imperiled natural world. Her projects use increasingly fantastical imagery and elaborate methods of construction to explore cycles of growth and decay and the dynamic tension between the passage of time and the photographic medium.

Marcuse began making photographs as an early college student at Bard College at Simon’s Rock before studying Art History and Studio Art at Oberlin College. She earned her MFA from Yale University, where she was awarded the George Sakier Memorial Prize for Excellence in Photography.

Her work is held in public collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the George Eastman Museum, the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., the Baltimore Museum of Art, and the Yale University Art Gallery. Marcuse is the recipient of numerous honors, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Peter S. Reed Grant, an American Scandinavian Fellowship, and two MacDowell Fellowships.

Marcuse’s photography has been exhibited internationally at venues such as the George Eastman Museum, Julie Saul Gallery, Hemphill Artworks, Galerie Miranda (Paris), Yoshii Gallery, the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, the Yale Art Gallery, Belfast Exposed Photography (Northern Ireland), and Las Palmas II Art Exhibition Centre (Rotterdam). Her recent solo exhibition Tanya Marcuse: Laws of Nature at the Denver Botanic Garden Art Gallery received critical attention in Hyperallergic.

Her work has been included in notable group shows, such as Dress Codes: The Third Triennial of Photography and Video at the International Center of Photography, and Heroines at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid, curated by Guillermo Solana. Her monumental piece Woven Nº 30 was featured in Actual Size, curated by David Campany.

The book form plays a significant role in Marcuse’s practice. Her published books include Undergarments and Armor (Nazraeli Press, 2005), Wax Bodies (Nazraeli Press, 2012), Fruitless | Fallen | Woven (Radius Press, 2019), Ink (Fall Line Press, 2021), and Portent (Nazraeli Press, 2024).

She is a dedicated student of martial arts and boxing as methods of cultivating mental and physical concentration and discipline. Marcuse is based in the Hudson Valley, in New York State and teaches Photography at Bard College.

Desaparecen?,Pablo Ortiz Monasterio,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-446-8Saddle-stitched (stapled), 6.5 x 9.25 inches, 68 pages, 43 color plates

“This book is both a document and an elegy. The regular edition is as modest as the students were poor: staple-bound, simple matt paper, and mono-toned ink and priced to be accessible in Mexico. The limited edition is priced to pay for the production of the former. The book’s layout is unorthodox and essential. It begins and ends with a list of the boys’ names and their youthful faces as they appear on the “have you seen?” handouts distributed by their parents. In between these lists is the photographer’s poignant homage and reckoning.” — Anne Wilkes Tucker

For centuries, artists have drawn on social and political events for inspiration. Fine artists have created art works that, taken directly from current controversial news, inform and move the viewer in ways that simple journalism or editorial commentary fall short.

Desaparecen? is an unusually poignant and moving art work that does not fall short. Created by Pablo Ortiz Monasterio, one of Mexico’s best known and influential photographers, Desaparecen? is a piercing work of photographs and poetic words beautifully collaged to implant in our memory a horrific event: the mysterious loss of 43 poor activist students traveling by bus (which they commandeered) to Mexico City to commemorate the anniversary of the 1968 Tlateloco Massacre. The details of their disappearance and probable massacre by authorities of Guerrero state have never come to light. The number “43” is recorded on every image of this work so we will never forget that number and remember also: the names of the students, “Donde quedaron”, “Justicia”, photographs of skeletal masks, photos of the students, “Donde Estan”, “vivas los queremos”, religious references.

Monasterio has created, on simple paper and a stapled document, an art work for the people: those who live and feel the tragedy of lives lost in such corruption. “Nunca Olvides”….Never Forget.

Tent Camera,Abelardo Morell,false,"ISBN 978-1-59005-482-6Hardcover, Slipcased, 10.5 x 15, 56 pages, 22 four-color platesLimited edition of 350 numbered and signed copies.

“I have always loved the 19th Century photographs of the American West by Carleton Watkins, Timothy O’Sullivan and William Henry Jackson but, when I had a commission to photograph these landscapes anew, the work of these men daunted me—so much so that, for a long time, I couldn’t imagine how I would approach making landscape images myself. But like many immigrants, I felt moved to explore the vastness of my adopted country.” — Abelardo Morell

Working with his assistant, C.J. Heyliger, Cuban-born artist Abelardo Morell has famously designed a light proof tent that, via periscope type optics, makes it possible to project a view of the nearby landscape onto whatever ground is under the tent. Inside this darkened space he uses a view camera to record the effect. This Tent-Camera now liberates Morell to use camera obscura techniques in a world of new places.""

Born in Havana, Cuba in 1948, Morell immigrated with his parents to the United States in 1962. His work has been collected and shown in many galleries, institutions and museums, including the Museum of Modern Art, The Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Art Museum in New York, The Chicago Art Institute, The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The Houston Museum of Art, The Boston Museum of Fine Art, The Victoria & Albert Museum and over seventy other museums in the United States and abroad.",Click images to enlarge,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559664976038-CIBPN7UIP9LULLNWG5GS/Morell_0_Cvr.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559664975895-B3T9S85NU8G8DTS11LP5/Morell_00_SlipCvr.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559664976083-4RJIE0O0IZU5ZB7OO2TX/Morell_1.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559664976297-2ESP36KKNQSWD0EVEQSQ/Morell_2.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559664976297-PAF0IC4JMRD41YLH9TUE/Morell_3.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559664976631-JN7OKDNSEE4U6JCDEEKM/Morell_4.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559664976686-UTE70UOOQRJUERN7I0ZL/Morell_5.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559664976974-J4ZGCOPIM0DZRN2EDGSB/Morell_6.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559664977107-NQFEOMLGSPD68YFLDLH1/Morell_7.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559664977402-Y41H119BTI3O9R2E3I31/Morell_8.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559664977498-K88DQ1U8E8ON42QA21M0/Morell_9.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559664977654-9VKFBPRKKR3XY7MYU7OP/Morell_10.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/abelardo-morell-tent-camera
Mantis,Daido Moriyama,false,"ISBN 978-1-59005-387-4Hardcover, Slipcased, 10 x 15, 48 pages, 21 duotone platesLimited edition of 350 numbered and signed copies.*NOTE: SPECIAL EDITION ALSO AVAILABLE HERE >

As one of the most celebrated and influential artists of his generation, Daido Moriyama has been the subject of dozens of books and films, and literally hundreds of exhibitions mounted around the world during the past three decades. His subjects are often sprawling, both geographically and metaphorically, with one influencing the next. In Mantis, however, the act of photographing becomes the subject of the book, decades after the fact.

In this beautifully produced artist’s book, Moriyama presents 21 frames printed as full-bleed enlargements, all from one contact sheet with an imprinted date of 1987. The book is divided into three unintended chapters, the result of Daido having photographed one subject until his was satisfied, moving on to the next, and then repeating this once more.

The book opens, fantastically, with a close-up of the hand of Masahisa Fukase, the artist’s friend and contemporary, holding a praying mantis which has caught the attention of them both; after several frames, Moriyama abruptly stops and then continues the roll of film inside of a studio apartment elsewhere. A female subject unwittingly and slowly becomes mantis-like in her poses, and gradually she merges into yet another subject, a mysterious set of portraits whose timelessness is given away only by the frames that preceded it.

Fleeting Gestures,Rj Muna,false,"Hardcover, 11.5x13 inches, 68 pages, 42 duotone plates.



RJ Muna’s photographic series, Fleeting Gestures, captures various images of birds mid-flight. Muna embraces the camera as a machine and its indifference to what it takes a picture of. With variations in the exposure, he creates intentionally blurred abstractions of individual birds that capture the essence of their motion. Varying levels of clarity create an interplay between the photographs that requires the viewer to see the whole selection in order to interpret what each image conveys. The velocity of flight creates an array of gestures, minimal in detail, that range from the upward ascent of the feathered edge of a wing to the curvilinear expressionist stroke of a horizon.

RJ Muna is an acclaimed photographer based in San Francisco, with a background in fine art, studio photography, and dance, and he is widely known for his innovative and evocative photography. Muna began his professional career shooting street demonstrations in in his hometown of Berkeley at age 16, in the waning years of the Vietnam era. After graduating with a degree in Art from San Jose State University, he would later go onto achieve over 150 national and international awards in his career as a commercial photographer, most notably receiving the Lucie award in 2003.

His film work has been featured and screened in many festivals including Art Basel Switzerland, Dance on Camera Festival, Dance Camera West, and the San Francisco Dance Film Festival.

Beautifully printed in duotone on Korean art paper, Fleeting Gestures features an accordion binding with cloth covers, presented in a raven-black cloth slipcase. The first edition of this exquisite artist’s book is limited to 750 copies.

“RJ Muna has created photographic versions of these invented glimpses, pictures that offer unrelated elements with an implausible balance, shifting back and forth between reality and surreality. These pictures of ‘indecisive moments’ led him to go further to consider the kind of glimpses that are entirely within the mind, seen only (and only occasionally) by the mind's eye.” — Owen Edwards",ISBN 978-1-59005-604-2,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/a47a9142-aad9-49cf-9562-b3e654c35580/00.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/8e8e08df-351f-4cd4-b91c-2fc20e6924d5/02.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/9c91eedf-74ee-4506-838a-f5f678cf4cc8/03.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/48497502-4d28-427a-8fd3-07e5a0322e8f/04.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/33c23131-3980-48ed-a455-8775d7d13c4b/05.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/5c0cf703-a8a4-4cd5-b768-7bd2f5181d0d/06.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/00b7123e-6e04-47a8-bd5b-1e277fabefc1/07.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/dd30856d-a971-489d-863f-75cb709d6cd7/08.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/5539856b-2ef2-4948-b1c3-88fbce98f19e/09.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1e0f99af-b418-4ef7-91a6-e8b4c286dcf4/010.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/2561b009-836c-4154-b7c1-f7e0ee17e6fd/011.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/c93ec91f-059f-4d56-bbf2-6e0dff340d7f/012.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/rj-muna-fleeting-gestures
Stop Tanks With Books,Mark Neville,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-586-1

Hardcover, 12 x 13, 180 pages, 80 four-color plates. Edited by David Campany

British artist Mark Neville moved home and studio from London to live in Kyiv, Ukraine, last year. With 100,000 Russian troops amassed on the Ukrainian border and the whole country on the cusp of war, Neville’s book project, Stop Tanks With Books, calls on the international community to urgently support Ukraine and help deter further Russian invasion.

Since 2015 Neville has been documenting life in Ukraine, with subjects ranging from holidaymakers on the beaches of Odessa, to the Roma communities on the Hungarian border, the churchgoers and nightclubbers of Kyiv, to both civilians and soldiers living on the frontline in Eastern Ukraine. Eighty of Neville’s photographs are brought together in this book, edited by David Campany, together with short stories about the conflict from Ukrainian novelist Lyuba Yakimchuk; research from the Centre of Eastern European Studies in Berlin about the 2.5 million Ukrainians already displaced by the war; and a call to action for the international community.

Employing his unique, activist strategy of a targeted book dissemination, Neville sent out 750 complimentary copies of the book’s first edition to key policymakers, opinion-makers, ambassadors, members of parliament, members of the international community and its media, as well as those involved directly in peace talks. The aim is for recipients of this book to be prompted into real action which will result in an end to the war, an end to the killing in Eastern Ukraine, and the withdrawal of Russian forces from occupied territories in Donbas and Crimea. An additional 750 copies were also available through Nazraeli Press for general distribution internationally, and quickly sold out.

Neville wrote in the first edition: “The atmosphere is extremely tense. Bomb shelters and siren drills are being prepared in the capital. Do we stay and fight? Or do we flee Ukraine completely? I wonder what the international response would be if Stockholm, London, Paris, or New York were threatened with an unprovoked and imminent invasion by Russia? Our book is a prayer and a necessary plea to the international community and Nazraeli Press and I have pulled out all the stops to get our book printed and disseminated before Putin invades."" Published post-invasion, this important second edition of the book includes an updated artist’s statement and maps.

Mark Neville’s work exists in different forms in many public and private collections, including those of the Archive of Modern Conflict, Arts Council of England, Kunstmuseum Bern, National Galleries of Scotland, and the Scottish Parliament. He has had major solo shows at The Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh, The Photographers’ Gallery, London, the Multimedia Art Museum of Moscow, and the Imperial War Museum, London, and participated in group shows at Jeu de Paume, Paris, Tate Britain, and Haus Der Kunst, Munich. His photo essay for the New York Times Magazine, Here Is London, was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 2013, and his monograph Fancy Pictures was nominated for both Time Magazine’s and the Aperture Foundation’s Photo Book of the Year 2017.

Paul Outerbridge: New Color Photographs,Paul Outerbridge,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-261-7Hardcover, 12 x 13, 88 pages, 50 four-color plates

The publication of ""Paul Outerbridge: New Color Photographs from Mexico and California, 1948-1955"" marks the discovery of a previously unknown and unpublished body of work by one of America’s earliest masters of color photography. Outerbridge built his extraordinary reputation by making virtuoso carbro-color prints of nudes and still lifes, mainly in the studio, during the 1930s. In the late 1940s and 1950s he took his camera to the streets, crossing the border between California and Mexico and photographing the people and places he found. In the tradition of such photographers as Edward Weston, Paul Strand, Anton Bruehl, and Henri Cartier-Bresson, all of whom made significant photographic forays into Mexico, Outerbridge ventured south in his 1949 black Cadillac, frequenting the seaport towns along the Baja peninsula. Shooting in bold, luminous Kodachrome, his photographs explore the quirkiness of 1950s leisure culture and examine the blending of two interwoven societies at a distinctive time in history. From governors to gauchos, and from stevedores to bathing beauties, Outerbridge captured the humanity, and occasionally the absurdity, of people as they gathered at weddings, pool parties, and picture spots. As brilliant and innovative today as when they were made, these images demonstrate a breathtaking mastery of the new art of color photography, and Outerbridge’s characteristic style and dramatic use of color anticipated the work of photographers who strove a quarter of a century later to develop a similar, bold new color vocabulary. The publication of this forgotten body of photographs includes an introduction by Outerbridge biographer Graham Howe and a preface and essay by curators William Ewing and Phillip Prodger.",Click images to enlarge,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1401398182671-VDFNOXIN6NP6GCRWN4AW/Outerbridge_Cover.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1401398182898-YI7YIPHUOE3YAQIIY42B/Outerbridge_Spread_001.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1401398183278-QI5VJLEMJSTCD9JLNGHE/Outerbridge_Spread_002.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1401398184127-9HFZPSNR7DCJ20ZWOQX6/Outerbridge_Spread_003.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1401398184901-UPJ5P7RAU2VZ22RGI0D0/Outerbridge_Spread_004.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/paul-outerbridge-paul-outerbridge-new-color-photographs
The Reservoir,Mimi Plumb,false,"Hardcover, 11.5x13 inches, 68 pages, 41 duotone plates.NOW SHIPPINGNote to European customers: please visit our UK website: www.nazraeli.co.uk

“From 2021 to 2023, I photographed around two reservoirs in the Central Valley of California experiencing a twenty-three year megadrought. The Reservoir weaves together images of the drying lakes and people seeking a leisurely day at the beach. They bring their dogs, babies and baby carriages, inner tubes, kayaks, rafts, umbrellas, coolers, and tents. As the summer progresses and the waterline recedes, families walk over a mile to reach the beach. At times, the sky is colored with smoke from nearby forest fires. The photographs in The Reservoir are part of an ongoing exploration in my work of how droughts, climate change, and ever-present anxiety collectively maps onto life in the American West.” — Mimi Plumb

It could be the last of our days, the way the water is receding, and the sun unrelenting. The reservoirs, once vast and overflowing, shrink before our eyes; the distance to reach the lapping shores growing vaster with every page. Humanity traveling that distance, what was once yards, now a mile or more. Mimi Plumb, in her new book, The Reservoir, follows the trail of people dotting the parched landscape, recording the plight, the pilgrimage, and the reward. The light is magical. The scenes are sublime. The moments are suspended. The sequence of images leads us to the water’s edge and lets us decide if we want to keep going or not.Mimi Plumb is part of a long tradition of socially engaged photographers concerned with California and the West. She received a 2022 Guggenheim Fellowship in support of her current project, Reservoir.Plumb will be the subject of a solo exhibition organized by the High Museum of Art, Atlanta in 2026. Her photographs are in the collections of the High Museum of Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Art Collection Deutsche Börse in Germany, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Pier 24, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Daum Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Yale University Art Gallery. She currently lives in Berkeley, California.

“Neil Krug’s stylized photos of his girlfriend [now wife], the model Joni Harbeck, were taken with Polaroid film years past its sell-by date. They have the kind of grainy, sun-scorched feel of a Sergio Leone spaghetti western. And ever since the couple began posting the photos on Flickr early this year, they’ve drawn a blaze of attention.” - The New York Times. Pulp - the multi-media collaboration between photographer Neil Krug and supermodel Joni Harbeck - has become a virtual sensation online, and is now the subject of the artists’ first monograph. 'Pulp Art Book: Volume One' is an LP-sized hardcover book, split into several vignettes ranging from a spaghetti western theme to a Bonnie and Clyde revival and to the struggles of a 1950s housewife. These series tell the story of each character, and will be expanded in subsequent volumes. The inspiration for the pulp theme comes from the artists’ collective appreciation of societal life and the artistic expressions of the 1960s and 70s. Old LP jackets, Giallo posters, vintage book covers, and B-movie cinema themes have defined their taste for this project. Initially they set out to capture something simple and sexy; as the shoots progressed, however, natural story lines emerged. The resulting work captures the smell of those decades and expresses them in a fresh way.

Dreams of Birds,Carol E. Richards,false,"SHIPPING DECEMBER 2022

Hardcover, 8.5 x 10.5 inches, 76 pages, 47 four-color plates



Carol E. Richards is a fine art photographer who captures the fleeting images of her avian subjects through a viewing scope, creating detailed portraits - simultaneously distant and near. Each feathered body in Dreams of Birds nearly fills the scope’s small oculus, as if in a spotlight before departing their small stage. To emphasize impermanence, the artist also documents the spaces left behind, prompting us to consider how we too are changed by absence. Seen as diptychs, her work explores the ephemeral natural world, “intimate yet vague, like a memory of a dream.”



Richards lived in Los Angeles for 30 years where she worked in commercial photography, television production, and art consulting while continuing her photography practice. Her artwork resides in numerous private and corporate collections.



This first edition volume of Dreams of Birds is limited to 750 copies. The book comprises 47 images beautifully printed on matte art paper and bound in cloth over boards. The artist’s first book, Birds have Wings, was published by Nazraeli Press in 2013 as part of our One Picture Book series.",ISBN 978-1-59005-524-3,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667478032506-GBZQ2NTDJN0UYBO1HOY7/Richards_0_Cvr.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667427098349-CVLOWFMQFAFBQB0426ZR/Richards_1.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667427098354-QTF2A0QC8PV2SL770NUY/Richards_2.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667427098353-MKB5JHBU3FR8PHI7DK09/Richards_3.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667427098353-YAUZGDAUGPG2OQZP5RXH/Richards_4.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667427098352-ZMRBM11GGNON16H9ERXB/Richards_5.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667427127481-6111TYQF104SVHNQ6CTW/Richards_6.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667427128104-BBU8HOKA295X3G97ZVZ0/Richards_7.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667427128155-CCG9RWE9THMCKM4QKMHL/Richards_8.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667427128212-OPCKP9CBRIVV4D5VFOAG/Richards_9.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667427128213-KYA4RWWE50ROOWDG9OX1/Richards_10.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1667427128204-ZHAR6NO1XCFNQCFNQ3LI/Richards_12.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/carol-e-richards-dreams-of-birds
Vanitas: The Palermo Portraits,Matthew Rolston,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-588-5

Hardcover: 12.5 x 18 x 1.5 inches, 118 pages, 50 four-color plates

Note to European customers: please visit our UK website: www.nazraeli.co.uk

Matthew Rolston’s Vanitas: The Palermo Portraits is a handsomely bound, generously sized limited-edition monograph – presented as a deluxe volume within a protective clamshell case.

Photographed in 2013 at the Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo, Sicily, Vanitas, a project more than a decade in the making, draws its visual language not from photographic tradition, but from painting. As inspiration, Rolston looked to the Austrian and Belgian Expressionists Egon Schiele and James Ensor, and to the School of London painters, especially Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud. From these artists he borrowed an unflinching gaze, a palette Rolston has described as “the colors of a bruise,” and a fascination with flesh as both physical material and emotional terrain. The portraits are staged with a highly controlled use of theatrical lighting. Viewing the work may confuse the eye. Are we seeing a painted surface, or the detailed forensics of a high-resolution photograph? Vanitas is not an act of documentation. It is a highly expressive reflection on imperfection and an inquiry into the ultimate truth of death. These portraits ask us not to turn away, but to consider what it means to see, and be seen, at the edge of mortality.

The publication includes texts from the artist in addition to an introductory essay by American author, photography critic and journalist Philip Gefter and a foreword excerpted from cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker’s seminal 1973 work The Denial of Death.

Redwood Saw,Richard Rothman,false,"In the summer of 2004, Richard Rothman traveled west with a 4x5 camera to explore the remaining fragments of ancient old-growth forests in Northern California. He pitched a tent amid the mammoth stands of redwoods and began making formal, intricate portraits of the forest, which he describes as 'the most visually stimulating environment I had ever been in.' Unexpectedly, he also began developing an interest in the neighboring town of Crescent City, an economically depressed logging and fishing community. Rothman was affected by the town s architecture, its emotional tenor, its political and religious culture, and the sometimes unconscious relationship that the townspeople had with the corralled forest to the east and the Pacific Ocean, which represents the end of the Western frontier. The contrast between the radical, spectacularly ornate environment of the forest and the trashed, disposable landscape of the town that abutted it became the subject of a more complex project which would take some surprising twists and turns. The body of work, made over a five-year period, is gathered together in the artist s monumental first book, Redwood Saw. This stunning monograph is an ambitious attempt to represent the culture, people, and landscape of Crescent City, and, by extension, the current American moment. Crescent City - a place that at one time must have seemed to possess an almost limitless abundance of natural resources - is revealed here as a compelling and dramatic model of a former boom town that staked its future on what can only be described as an 'unsustainable cultural and economic reality.' Beautifully printed in duotone on matt art paper, this first printing of Redwood Saw is limited to 1,500 casebound copies. Richard Rothman's work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the International Center of Photography, New York; the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, Paris; the Brooklyn Museum; and the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona, Tucson.",Click images to enlarge,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095648354-HJ2ZKFD52RFY1NO5URHU/Rothman_Redwood_Cvr.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095647633-Y0SOFMESKSR4F13JB6UU/Rothman_Redwood_spreads_001.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095648687-2ULMMGU5BRF2W9669PVA/Rothman_Redwood_spreads_002.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095650493-6OEHQ2JTOB4UEQBDXOZ4/Rothman_Redwood_spreads_003.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095650309-PH9VXYZ9MVNDHF99TP6B/Rothman_Redwood_spreads_004.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095651439-DO09FMD43N86MSHN19D1/Rothman_Redwood_spreads_005.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095651625-M14K2507FDH3JSFZKYC9/Rothman_Redwood_spreads_006.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1397095651981-2I2668MVID0N2OSBG0E9/Rothman_Redwood_spreads_007.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/richard-rothman-redwood-saw
East Lyme: Two Visits to Walker Evans’ House in Connecticut,Mark Ruwedel & James Welling,false,"ISBN 978-1-59005-545-8Hardcover, 8 x 11 inches, 32 pages, 12 duotone and four-color plates



Walker Evans lived in this house in East Lyme, Connecticut, from 1967 until shortly before his death in 1975. The house was designed by Evans and his friend Robert Busser, a Yale architecture student. Letters and postcards were often addressed to Old Lyme or Lyme because their Mail truck turned around at Stewart’s Corner, East Lyme.

Dale Callaway, current owner of the house, writes: “What changed was the post office deciding it was about time for East Lyme to take over that route. A letter would arrive here with almost any address on it because the majority of Mail carriers just knew who lived where.”

James Welling visited in August, 2016. Mark Ruwedel visited in January, 2018. They were unaware of each other’s visits until later. The black-and-white photographs are by Ruwedel. The color photographs are by Welling.

This first edition of East Lyme: Two visits to Walker Evans’ House in Connecticut is limited to 500 copies.

James Welling is an American artist, photographer and educator living in New York City. His work is represented in such permanent collections as Art Institute of Chicago; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Modern Art, New York; Tate Modern, London; and Whitney Museum of American Art.

Mark Ruwedel is an American landscape photographer and educator. His work is represented in such permanent collections as J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

Palms and Capri,Mark Ruwedel,false,"ISBN: 1-59005-501-4 / 1-59005-502-1Slipcased set of two hardcover books, each 11 x 14. Total 88 pages, 40 duotone plates.

Several years ago, Mark Ruwedel posed to himself the question of how to photograph his adopted home of Los Angeles. There was, of course, a variety of answers to such a sprawling question. Ed Ruscha, and his own photographs of LA in the 1960s, provided one map. Nigel Raab’s epic walk across the basin provided another. But noticing that the words “palms” and “capri” appear in the names of so many LA apartment buildings provided the key to the project at hand. The word ‘palms’ is quintessentially ‘Los Angeles’, both in its connotations of paradise and as a plant that may or may not be present near the buildings that are named for it – “promise vs. reality in the City of Angels” – and ‘Capri’ is as ubiquitous for its appearance in the proper names of apartment buildings, and refers in that function to … an Italian island?

Palms Capri is a two-volume set of limited edition books, each containing twenty photographs of Los Angeles apartment buildings whose names contain one or the other of these two implied features. Beautifully printed in duotone on uncoated art paper, Palms Capri is published in an edition of 150 hand-numbered, individually slipcased copies. A special edition featuring two exhibition quality, gelatin silver photographs printed by the artist, presented in a custom clamshell box, is available here.

Mark Ruwedel is a photographer based in California. The author of over a dozen books, Ruwedel is a Guggenheim fellow and was shortlisted for the Deutsche Börse Photography Prize 2019 for his exhibition, The Artist and Society, at Tate Modern. Ruwedel’s photographs are widely exhibited and collected, and are housed in the permanent collections of the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; L.A. County Museum of Art, Los Angeles; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; among many other prominent museums. A deluxe edition, featuring two signed and numbered original prints measuring 11 x 14 inches, is available in an edition of 25 copies.

Route 66: 1973-1974,John Schott,false,"ISBN 978-1-59005-388-1Hardcover, Slipcased, 12 x 15, 60 pages, 47 duotone platesLimited edition of 350 numbered and signed copies.*NOTE: SPECIAL EDITION WITH PRINT ALSO AVAILABLE HERE >

In the summer of 1973, John Schott drove Route 66 from the midwest to California and back, sleeping in his pick-up truck and photographing with an 8x10-inch Deardorf view camera. Among his subjects were vintage motels situated along the highway, and it was a selection of these photographs that, two years later, were included in William Jenkins’ seminal New Topographics exhibition at the George Eastman House.

The twenty images that were included in this exhibition have been well-documented, though never reproduced in a manner showing the richness of detail and tone displayed in the original contact prints.

We are pleased to announce that, as part of our NZ Library, a beautifully printed, oversized book is now available which presents not only the 20 photographs originally shown from this important body of work, but all 47 photographs included in the artist’s complete set of archived images. This important new publication opens with an illuminating essay by Britt Salvesen, Department Head and Curator of the Wallis Annenberg Department of Photography, and the Department Head and Curator of Prints and Drawings, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and a leading expert on the subject.

John Schott’s photographs are held in the permanent collections of many public collections, including those of The George Eastman House, Rochester, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; and the Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University Art Museums.

In a previous century Americans migrated west in Prairie Schooners to become farmers or shopkeepers. After the Second World War they continued this ‘Westward Ho!’, but now in commercially-fabricated mobile homes, often to retirement. These new pioneers clustered in communities that transformed the western landscape and its built environment through a new architecture of mobility. Mobile home manufacturers produce a range of styles with architectural references that animate cultural aspirations or memories of home and community left behind. After choosing a basic style, new owners make individual touches to the exterior and lawn that transform the generic into the personal. Viewed from a surrounding hillside, mobile home parks look like arabesques of uniform aluminum boxes.

*NOTE: SPECIAL EDITION ALSO AVAILABLE HERE >“The end of the 1970s saw the completion of Japan's postwar construction, as well as a withering of the student movement and the various terrorist acts that had shaken the global community. The early 1980s was a brief interlude of calm, anticipating the end of the long Showa era, before Japan was deluged by the bubble economy. I had just returned to Japan in 1980, after studying for four years in Flanders where time moves slowly, and the atmosphere is very relaxed. In addition to the rapidly advancing westernization, the reality of this new Tokyo, where old pre-war Showa is blended with modern Showa (post-war) looked disorderly and chaotic to me, and it was not easy to capture it visually. I struggled to realize my own mode of expression in this home country of mine, and began by chasing lights of the night-time to deflect this chaos.” – Toshio Shibata, from the AfterwordBorn in Japan in 1949, Toshio Shibata entered the painting department of the University of Arts of Tokyo in 1968. He later decided to continue his studies in Europe at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Gant (Belgium) where he turned to photography. It was upon his return to Japan in 1980 that he made the haunting, nighttime photographs of Tokyo presented here for the first time.Toshio Shibata’s work is included in the permanent collections of museums around the world, including The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; J.

Easy Days,Sage Sohier,false,"Note to European customers: please visit our UK website: www.nazraeli.co.uk



“These pictures describe a long-ago time, and yet in looking at them I become once again the young photographer who took them on a hot summer day, sweat and dust pungent on the breeze; in the distance, I can hear the laughter of children who are now middle-aged.” — Sage Sohier, from the introductory interview by Mark Steinmetz

We are pleased to announce Easy Days, the third title in Sage Sohier’s trilogy which also includes Americans Seen and Passing Time. Made between 1978 and 1986, the 56 photographs presented in Easy Days capture the prosaic moments of ordinary people, always with respect and often with humor.

Sohier finds her subjects in the open spaces of parking lots, front yards and public streets, and in the quieter confines of modest homes, back yards and porches. She depicts “the boredom of hot summer days” with a precise attention to the surroundings, with cold drinks, propane grills, sprinklers and pets each providing small comforts and revealing the quiet tempo of the days. Sohier’s observation that “images…gain a historical perspective over time that adds to their interest,” is proven true in this collection of black and white images.

Sage Sohier’s work has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the International Center for Photography, New York; and the Art Institute of Chicago, among many other venues. Her photographs are included in the permanent collections of such institutions as the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Cleveland Museum of Art, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City; and the Brooklyn Museum.","ISBN: 978-1-59005-619-6Hardcover, 10.5 x 12 inches, 76 pages, 56 duotone plates.",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/29933768-0024-4c24-85fd-812acabc197e/00.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/d638ad7a-1cce-4795-8450-aa422d7ecc59/01.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/535e300c-88dd-4b62-93fe-adbc99e63494/02.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/3e918b9c-63dc-43a9-abc4-04452e6ed6c2/03.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/c08203a0-527b-474b-99fa-58ba28c024f5/04.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/02195fbe-44c3-45d7-81cb-fc86e1094b6a/05.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/a509f64a-37f6-4e10-aa4a-0b1a7f4129a4/07.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/79acb902-7e4c-46c4-b1a0-7575a4a92831/08.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/c46ba4f6-e6b7-4dca-bc18-7afe992ae669/09.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/ef028bbd-f262-4a2a-902f-5e5604b1290b/010.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1b43e832-0281-4e66-867f-51d13643af0c/011.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/905d4923-7ed8-4064-b729-3099ee7f8c12/012.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/a7769144-9f8b-42fb-9d62-22bca0cd1d74/013.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/f9da2417-d882-45a2-9708-edf3f0c4765c/014.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/23f846f4-5cdb-43e0-8dc0-a85d0420ed0d/015.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/e62e4741-25b3-4770-9d01-bb71f9e50abd/016.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/12f27c1b-56a6-4aab-ab10-4a5adc08d316/017.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/fb9f447b-11f5-40f3-adbe-ba63cef80ade/018.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/sage-sohier-easy-days
ATL,Mark Steinmetz,false,"American photographer Mark Steinmetz photographed the people and environs of Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport between 2012 and 2019 as part of the High Museum of Art’s Picturing the South series, a photographic archive that examines a range of themes specific to the American South. The 64 black-and-white images in ATL emphasize “the quiet transitional moments in this liminal world,” writes curator Gregory J. Harris in the volume’s introduction. Steinmetz captures “the more introspective moments” of travel in and out of the world’s most heavily trafficked airport and includes travelers of all ages “leaving one chapter of their lives and going to another,” as the artist stated in a 2019 interview at the museum. Airline pilots, ground personnel, flight attendants, and janitors are also pictured, always working, often waiting; they share a space with the travelers but remain apart. Steinmetz also turns his focus to the open spaces around the airport, presenting vast, overgrown, and often unpeopled areas that provide a sharp contrast to the busy workings of the airport and its constantly changing population. A selection of images taken from aircraft windows depict the graphic beauty of clouds, light streaks, and jet trails, echoing the “sense of levity and mystery” felt by those traveling, as well as those viewing the photographs. Though taken over a period of years, this collection of images evokes the distinct timelessness of air travel, “capturing ordinary yet captivating human dramas that play out in the public spaces across the airport.” ATL is the 15th volume of Mark Steinmetz’s work published by Nazraeli Press. Born in 1961, Mark Steinmetz lives in Athens, Georgia. He is a Guggenheim Fellow, with work in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. ATL opens with an introduction by Gregory J. Harris, Keough Family Curator of Photography at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta. He graduated from Yale’s MFA photography program in 1986.

Chicago,Mark Steinmetz,false,"Hardcover, cloth, 10.5 x 12 inches, 148 pages, 129 duotone plates. NOW SHIPPING

We are thrilled to announce the publication of Chicago by Mark Steinmetz. This extraordinary group of photographs, made between 1988 and 1991, provides a compelling portrait both of the city itself and of the time in which they were made.

Steinmetz’s relationship with Chicago is an important and evolving aspect of his artistic journey. While he is primarily associated with the South, Chicago has long been a city that has inspired his creative exploration. Chicago’s distinct neighborhoods, architecture, and energy offered Steinmetz a rich source of material, allowing him to capture the city’s quiet moments and intimate portraits of its residents. Chicago showcases a unique perspective of the city and and is an important chapter in Steinmetz’s ongoing dialogue with the broader American landscape. Born in 1961, Mark Steinmetz lives in Athens, Georgia. He is a Guggenheim Fellow, with work in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Chicago opens with an essay by Peter Galassi, Chief Curator of Photography at the MoMA, New York, from 1991 to 2011. Beautifully printed in duotone on a special matte art paper, and bound with a two-tone brown linen over boards, this first printing is limited to 1,500 copies and was published to coincide with an exhibition of the same name at Stephen Daiter Gallery in Chicago.

*NOTE: SPECIAL EDITION ALSO AVAILABLE HERE >“I entered the Yale School of Art straight from college and left after my first semester. I was 21. I was restless, curious about the America that lay beyond New England, and had a strong interest in the movie industry; I also had heard that Garry Winogrand was somewhere in Los Angeles so in the summer of 1983 I headed west.” – Mark Steinmetz, from the PrefaceAngel City West offers a touching, highly personal look at Los Angeles through the eyes of Mark Steinmetz as a young artist straight out of school. In his preface to the work, Steinmetz describes living in a studio apartment in the Miracle Mile district, complete with a futon surrounded by a dozen roach motels and a makeshift darkroom set up in a tiny nook off of the bathroom. It didn’t take long before he ran into Garry Winogrand, for whom he became a kind of unofficial chauffeur, enabling Winogrand to photograph through the car window while Steinmetz navigated the streets of his new home town.Viewed together in book form, the 58 photographs presented in Angel City West document Steinmetz finding his own voice as an artist. In light of the later projects for which he has become so well known, this early series of street photographs, informal portraits and landscapes foreshadows the sometimes humorous, oftentimes sad, and always poignant mood that runs through Mark Steinmetz’s work.Mark Steinmetz’s photographs have been exhibited extensively throughout the United States and Europe, and are included in the permanent collections of many important institutions including The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

“Mark Steinmetz makes photographs of ordinary people in the ordinary landscapes they inhabit. His frames document those fluid moments of real, lived life, moments not just grabbled or stolen, but ones where he says, ‘It’s important to take an internal pause.’ An element of the seeming offhand magic in his photographs is how his sense of this “internal pause,” of a near cinematic freeze frame, only enhances his images’ apparent spontaneity. The best art often hides its technique . . . Steinmetz is, in fact, is a “street” photographer: a 21st century embodiment of the 19th century flâneur, a man in the world, sensitive to ephemeral moments as photographic capsules of our larger lives. This will come as no surprise to anyone who knows Steinmetz’s artistic history as a mentee of Garry Winogrand.

You don’t have to be a creature of the urban streetscapes that Steinmetz so closely observes in this book in order to “get” his work. From his books of photographs of Greater Atlanta, to the small world of a children’s baseball diamond in The Players, Mark Steinmetz’s camera focuses closely on these ordinary, even banal, moments of people’s daily lives, even when in some images, the people themselves are absent at the instant of the camera exposure. Like the more formal compositions of Cartier-Bresson, Steinmetz’s photographs capture their own “decisive moment,” less stylized for sure, but often more animated: simply the images of an “American” photographer.” — From the Introduction by John Bailey

SHIPPING SEPTEMBER, 2017. We are pleased to announce the publication of Volume 2 in Mark Steinmetz’s triology Angel City West. Building upon the narrative he began with Volume 1, published in NZL Set 2, Steinmetz presents 51 previously unpublished photographs made during his stay in Los Angeles in 1981–84.

John Bailey, renowned cinematographer and expert on the history of cinematography, provides a thoughtful introduction from the perspective of his own chosen medium, as well as that of a Los Angeles native.

“I am now the same age that Garry Winogrand had been when I knew him – 56. I was just 22 then and now wonder why he had be willing to spend some time with someone so young. I must have come across as OK and probably mentioned some of the right names: Friedlander, Wessel, Zulpo-Dane. Once he called me up (the first time was startling to me as he must have looked up my name in the phone book) to see what I was up to the next day. I said, “If it’s sunny, I’m going to photograph; if it’s rainy, I’m going to print.” “Likewise,” he said. Maybe in some ways we were similar.

One day I asked Garry to go with me to photograph at the LA Zoo and he agreed. We had a full day and shot until the light faded. As we were nearing the exit, Garry spotted Bernadette Peters, the famous movie and Broadway actress, who was visiting the zoo with her boyfriend. Garry photographed her before on the set of John Huston’s movie, Annie. She and her boyfriend were dressed in identical jeans and jackets. Strikingly, they both had the same drooping, poodle-like hairstyle. Surprised, she threw her head back and shrieked with delight when Garry swooped in to take their picture. Out in the parking lot he sank into the passenger seat and said, “Boy, you don’t know how tired you are till you sit down.”

In February of 1984, I called him up to say I had decided to leave town and move back east. His voice on the other end of the phone sounded terrible, very weak. I had no idea what was going on with him – it was shocking. He wished me “the best of luck.” The following month, a couple weeks before my 23rd birthday, I was at my parents’ house in Hartford and my mother brought me the New York Times. Without saying a word, she pointed to Garry’s obituary. During the time we spent together, there had been a cancer growing inside of him but he didn’t know it. Garry was always looking outward, beyond himself.

ISBN: 978-1-59005-532-8Hardcover, cloth, 10.5 x 12 inches, 72 pages, 57 plates.

Highly regarded for his black-and-white portraits, Mark Steinmetz is renowned for producing powerful pictures that capture the strong sense of displacement and isolation felt by many young Americans. His celebrated trilogy “South” (consisting of South Central, South East, and Greater Atlanta) was published by Nazraeli Press between 2007 and 2009, and offers a lyrical and evocative look at American culture and notions of progress.

We are pleased to announce a new, remastered edition of these three important titles. The format, sequence and design are true to the original printings. The materials, however, have been upgraded; the books are now bound in cloth over board, and printed in quadratone on a special matte art paper.

Long out of print, South Central, South East and Greater Atlanta have been elusive goals for many libraries. This remastered release will be a welcome addition to any good library of photographic books.South CentralRenowned for his modest yet powerful photographs that capture the sense of displacement and isolation felt by many young Americans, Mark Steinmetz photographed in and around Knoxville, Tennessee to create the work that makes up South Central. The title of the book is derived from the South Central Bell telephone company that serves Knoxville, and their public pay phones are a recurring theme in this work; an iconic reminder of the area's socio-economic condition. The artist possesses an uncanny ability to pull folly, aggression and tenderness through his lens simultaneously, and delivers with this book a powerful and touching visual novel of the human condition.

“Mark Steinmetz works in a venerable tradition of photographic prowling that bets everything on the ordinary. Each picture is the fruit of an unplanned encounter: Though the photographer may know more or less where he is going, he can’t know precisely what he will find. An accumulation of these improvised perceptions can make both a world and a way of looking at it.” — from the Introduction by Peter Galassi",Click images to enlarge,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879992304-5543P8G9NQUOJKLQN5GP/SE_Cover.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879979636-XON5HHJUWEB9ATP8BGZ4/SE_1.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879980841-64WTT7JNYU0AG7ISY0WI/SE_2.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879981518-UX3FLIMAS1CZSG7HY6FV/SE_3.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879981955-16ECZ47B6M3B7KM0Q7MP/SE_4.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879982799-G3FCAB5GC3GMVODF134I/SE_5.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879982968-YNHTRI2IQJ09GID9COVL/SE_6.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879984163-Z5043NGW4HWBE3TB20UR/SE_7.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879984287-48YKCXR7Z7TBZ2MNZXXY/SE_8.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879985332-GCK0U9R3G43BIYCN2OWD/SE_9.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879985331-GYU4AAC2PS3H7KHJ54V9/SE_10.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879986716-Y0GSZQ9UUY53NVEKI5F7/SE_11.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879987856-VIVMQ3IFH5XE4SSVGQ2V/SE_12.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879987937-4BHHZBP2ER8U1V6I099X/SE_13.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879989088-29KMFKJ7SC26HIK7Y9FW/SE_14.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879989417-HX07G7051ZESNXWONT4A/SE_15.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602879991739-S09XEI1U8AYBY7DEYS9U/SE_16.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/mark-steinmetz-south-east

Long out of print, South Central, South East and Greater Atlanta have been elusive goals for many libraries. This remastered release will be a welcome addition to any good library of photographic books.Greater AtlantaMark Steinmetz completes his powerful and moving trilogy, 'South', with Greater Atlanta. Photographing in Atlanta and its outlying regions, Steinmetz provides his testimony on contemporary American civilization. Combining portraits and landscapes, he weaves a symbolic and lyrical investigation that subtly questions notions of progress. He further develops motifs — on the automobile, on the telephone — that were first introduced in 'South Central', and catalogues car culture, fast food, convenience stores, and suburban sprawl.

“South is an elegant and quiet collection of black-and-white photographs drawn from the artist’s decades-long career photographing the southeastern United States, primarily in Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi. Steinmetz’s images are imbued with an intrinsically Southern tenderness, melancholy and longing that is universally resonant. The work is documentary in nature but he brings a sublime seeing to his subjects, captured with a nod towards beauty and dignity and very much in keeping with the approach of Southern grace.” — LENSCRATCH",Click images to enlarge,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880163935-GGRV5ADNBPW6HLHB5O0I/GA_Cover.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880149907-HIZAZBQ4Q1TQ7E95CH6Y/GA_1.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880150063-94V1U9YCD72ZRZEXFBKW/GA_2.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880151541-T17JFIODEBFOCGIZS25R/GA_3.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880151537-RSBAUEXROH0H5U6Y7615/GA_4.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880153373-CY1B7XQ225CARVPK8CKH/GA_5.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880153250-OXGMKDVTF024V88KRJWJ/GA_6.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880154511-GCPKER2A7RGMM95HIE8F/GA_7.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880155446-QRIDBA0YA3PDOT9EYFPR/GA_8.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880157125-C1B0G2HYQ3E375YW4R07/GA_9.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880158998-GA00W5Z7CIC6GHCOF18J/GA_10.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880159161-CXUYZXL0699DB9Q9NKOT/GA_11.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880160484-EE146SBNANC24E4ZHK3K/GA_12+copy.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880160490-HX6SP3G0BJAC5936IPWQ/GA_12.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880161718-2XTCTST68Y0F2D016T50/GA_13.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880162207-SWOHK715E4UDDY6VM1R0/GA_14.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880162944-0RM0IKD74ZD8J89GI8BO/GA_15.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1602880163186-A3O6ZJC3MZE640DJNLTJ/GA_16.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/mark-steinmetz-greater-atlanta
Summer Camp,Mark Steinmetz,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-513-7Hardcover, 10.5 x 12 inches, 92 pages, 80 duotone plates.

Our newest monograph on the work of photographer Mark Steinmetz is a collection of photographs that capture the spirit of youth during trips spent away at a summer camp.

""Two projects I focused on were little league baseball [The Players published by Nazraeli Press in 2015] and summer camps. Every year, from spring into summer, one would lead into another and certain things never changed…At summer camp, you have sleeping bags, cabins and camp res. There isn’t much difference between them in 1990 or 1965.

I like that time of age, too. There’s a kind of grave maturity developing at around 11 years old. When a little kid laughs or cries, it doesn’t have real resonance, whereas if someone has these emotions between eight and 12, there’s a poignancy to it.

When they become adults, it’s just not the same. Many of these photos are about the predicament of being a kid put into a certain situation. In one picture, these girls who have been so horrible to each other all summer are now parting – and the depth of their love just gushes out. It’s almost excruciating..."" — Mark Steinmetz, for Huck Mag",LIMITED QUANTITY,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573792017075-OUNMPXL8IDXZB6F0FCPO/0_Cvr.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573792016760-RV7BPNXXA4OT03S46HPM/1.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573792018560-87ZUII1XE3PIVEZP4Q48/2.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573792018800-99U5VDHIWTGPZW72LP8N/3.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573793485183-OHSQYBHTSKJ0TCXU3SN4/6.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573792019823-60JATFGGS9QFS06WG43Q/4.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573792020622-0CX5TLJ7211LA7MF6NQX/5.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573793484112-IFQA01CZPMGVHQGXF0EK/7.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573793486549-K7SJFX17NTV2LHVOXZNW/8.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573793487005-LVQPMCFSOYGYBGGOLESF/9.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573793488250-E2427D02H5WTSTJX7EPZ/10.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573793488477-6CLX7S7A59D8CNNHGQM8/11.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573793489761-ZCDKOZGBA5YLE8KYUHIJ/12.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573793490182-O2G6TCEAATJ88TTELI3S/13.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573793490841-MC5KB1ZOPHY17ITQ0LT7/14.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573793491163-5GBXZ5Y4SSQ7DI7Z4NPP/15.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573793491718-1GNPZX344PY0O9U0WLAB/16.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1573793492056-TZSFJTI9R1CPNGG8L2WG/17.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/mark-steinmetz-summer-camp

SHIPPING MID FEBRUARY

Note to European customers: please visit our UK website: www.nazraeli.co.uk

Nazraeli Press is delighted to announce a remastered and greatly expanded edition of the epic Mark Steinmetz monograph, Summertime. First published in 2011 as a follow up to his South Central trilogy, Summertime is a series of portraits of young children and teenagers caught in the midst of activity in distinctly American settings. Made between 1984 and 1991, when kids were able to roam their neighborhoods with less supervision than today, riding bikes without wearing helmets, and hanging out without constant digital interruptions, these black and white photographs capture the light and feel of an endless summer. Beautifully printed in duotone on natural art paper, this new edition of Summertime includes 30 previously unpublished images, and is limited to 2,000 casebound copies.A special edition of 100 signed and slipcased copies is available here >Mark Steinmetz is a Guggenheim Fellow. His work is included in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.“The images were taken in places where the photographer was either living, visiting his parents or teaching. That connection affords Steinmetz a familiarity and comfort and enables an ease he strives for with the strangers he photographs, which is reflected in the pictures. In black and white, things can rest a little easier in the frame. Summertime is more about the kids and that feeling of having all the time in the world in summer—and in the middle of winter, Summertime is what we yearn for most.” — Time",ISBN 978-1-59005-587-8,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/31777577-9ba5-4090-8dba-16d4a3e4b8dd/0+Cvr.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/994d6e51-e455-416c-8693-9775facbc263/01.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/d7db6a94-c1b8-4d5e-8d52-4a4a5ca081d4/02.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/00bb005f-cce7-40a5-970e-61f811fdc7c3/03.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/0d762577-9c1b-4f34-9d40-c59a96098e67/04.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/333ee9e8-e506-497e-a085-f9e44985075d/05.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/e3c36a19-6f04-4ee5-95b8-e0d7c5e763aa/06.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/585c68fb-9c9e-492e-8ca1-f07a2f22503b/07.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/50caa4bb-ac1f-4eed-8589-3dd1102a5450/08.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/be065dff-e3e5-4838-9798-f6cc11fcf219/09.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/318b71df-7a5c-45e4-b9b4-08a4a897b87c/11.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/efd7097a-a6ec-4b92-b7f2-5e34b1b96cb9/12.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/15e71556-e2b6-4bbb-bf67-65bd06c45594/12a.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/e05d1168-f8db-496c-b572-a09023feea45/13.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/a10e7603-26b6-413e-adb0-f284876dc6bc/14.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/287a2eba-a286-4353-bcc1-ecf1eb59316a/15.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/d23039ee-7e07-4f50-b29e-b5fdea0883ef/16.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/6d887c3a-0ff9-4ca8-97e8-27418cdda25c/17.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/ec167868-5e3d-42ac-8ee7-caf3358981b2/18.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/139549c3-347e-411a-bb30-49b51825bd4e/19.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/9b013a1e-69ee-4e61-91ef-4759b70292d3/21.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/mark-steinmetz-summertime
Our Ocean's Edge,Jasmine Swope,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-419-2Hardcover, 12 x 12 inches, 96 pages, 55 duotone plates.

California made history with the creation of the nation’s first statewide system of ocean parks − a network of 124 Marine Protected Areas stretching from Oregon to the Mexico border. Like national parks on land, MPAs are magnificent in beauty and wildness while providing protection for wildlife, solutions to climate change, and recreational resources for all. Soon after the system was established, photographer Jasmine Swope set out to capture the essence of the marine parks. Her quest took her up and down California’s 1,100-mile long coastline. The result is “Our Ocean’s Edge,” a photographic documentary project coupled with original narratives written by author Dwight Holing that celebrates these fragile seascapes while increasing awareness about their natural benefits and inspiring conservation action. This beautiful clothbound monograph comprises 55 plates beautifully printed in duotone, and opens with a foreword by Wallace J Nichols. A special edition, featuring a signed original photograph presented with a copy of the book in a custom clamshell box, is also available.

Swope's photographs have the soft look of richly worked, large-scale graphite drawings. In addition to her chosen printing technique, it is achieved through lengthy exposures that blur contours, enhance atmospherics and blend the motions of waves and birds into gentle near-abstractions. One result is to recast familiar sights, recorded in millions of snapshots of tourist scenery, into something alien and almost extraterrestrial. Rocky outcroppings rising above foggy gray swirls of luminosity might be on some far-off mountaintop or even on a Hollywood backlot. They're like mysterious landscapes glimpsed on another planet. That they're actually close to home makes the visual estrangement salutary. Swope's camera can only show the world's surface; however lovely the outward appearance might be, the complex but largely hidden dynamic of a habitat is what matters. Her photographs deftly evoke the presence of more than the eye can see.

Los Angeles x Shinjuku,Avo Tavitian & Daido Moriyama,false,"Hardcover, 8x10.5 inches, 76 pages, 48 duotone plates.



Published to coincide with an exhibition of the same name, Los Angeles x Shinjuku presents a face-to-face selection of work from Daido Moriyama’s ongoing Shinjuku, Tokyo series and Avo Tavitian’s photographs of Los Angeles made over the past three decades.

Born in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1954, Avo Tavitian’s journey to photography is marked by a profound connection to his changing surroundings. Shaped by the experience of moving to the Eastern shore of the United States with his family in the late 1960s, following the 1967 Middle East war, Tavitian developed a sense of being an outsider during his formative teen years in New Jersey and New York City, a sensibility that would later influence his work as a photographer after his relocation to Los Angeles in the mid-1980s.

Born in 1938 in Osaka, Japan, Daido Moriyama is a pivotal figure in contemporary photography, celebrated for his evocative black-and-white street photography that captures the essence of urban life. In recording the subcultures of Tokyo during his career he gravitated to the dense, dynamic and often gritty ward of Shinjuku. He employs a raw, spontaneous style characterized by high contrast and grainy textures. His iconic images explore themes of identity, memory, and the fleeting moments of everyday existence.

Tavitian and Moriyama both focus on framing everyday subjects, capturing moments on 35mm film while embracing the unpredictability of the medium. Their work reflects a deep fascination with urban landscapes and a curiosity about the mundane, as they seeks to document the changes and constants in his field of vision. Through their explorations, both photographers use the camera to navigate the complexities of belonging and identity in an ever-shifting human environment.

Rust Belt,Jack Teemer,false,"ISBN 978-1-59005-485-7Hardcover, Slipcased, 12 x 15, 48 pages, 35 four-color platesLimited edition of 350 numbered copies, signed by Joan Teemer

“Jack D. Teemer’s photographs taken in American Rust Belt cities during the 1980s examine the ways in which neighborhoods and urban infrastructure have been shaped by the industry that surrounds them. His pictures quietly celebrate the ways in which humans strive to live together in the shadow of manufacturing—even in its decline.

Cinematic vistas, presenting a wide view of a city’s urban structure, set the stage for pictures that focus more narrowly on neighborhoods and individual yards. Bridges and freeways loom over homes and restaurants; fences surround each home; signs, automobiles and gardens crowd each yard; children jump from porches and play with hoses. Although many of these yards have seen better days, the diverse residents of communities who call them home cultivate and enliven their small plots of land. Teemer records these distinctive American Rust Belt stories, from the cities on the verge of economic and civic recovery to the families who live boisterously in close quarters, with great care for the human experience.” — From the Introduction by Lisa Sutcliffe, Herzfeld Curator of Photography and Media Arts, Milwaukee Art Museum`

Jack D. Teemer (1948–1992) photographed working-class neighborhoods in cities like Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, and Dayton, often focusing on residential backyards. This intimate approach affords the viewer insight to various societal factors such as economic conditions and zoning, as well as revealing how individuals in dense neighborhoods shape their own private spaces through landscaping and decoration.

In the early 1980s, Teemer joined an expanding group of practitioners who embraced color photography, and challenged the notion that it was somehow subservient to black-and-white photography. His work was presented alongside several preeminent color photographers such as Joel Meyerowitz, Stephen Shore, and William Eggleston in the important survey, American Independents: Eighteen Color Photographers (Eauclaire, Abbeville, 1987).

Two decades later, after Teemer’s death, it was featured in, Where We Live: Photographs from the Berman Collection (Getty Trust Publications, 2006). This group exhibition and subsequent book placed Teemer’s work within a meaningful dialog with other photographers who have described aspects of the American social landscape.",Click images to enlarge,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559680967264-VCZ3UIQASMECE9OKL8NT/Teemer_0_Cvr.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559680967262-K7MHLABB7F9J69LJRI85/Teemer_00_SlipCvr.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559680967435-57C8I08NE3PPWJIP8V0N/Teemer_1.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559680967533-RDDIN7ZSHBFQJAIZFHCH/Teemer_2.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559680967664-V2VIRYVWBJNQI5QXP8SX/Teemer_3.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559680968017-3Q53S35EQKAN7FP27ZPM/Teemer_4.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559680967926-4E39LD7N7X0B7DBNP3KT/Teemer_5.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559680968235-TX4R442VS4AOBRSVHB8X/Teemer_6.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559680968409-I4N8IWB0K1U0ARRPIWLY/Teemer_7.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559680968570-YCZQJN1NOCV2L8RQH3HS/Teemer_8.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559680968724-CMFELU0W5DMV1YFBY7RT/Teemer_9.jpg|https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52f7fcdbe4b056ca2bfd5443/1559680968887-TL2RGKLQATYL1AEA2T85/Teemer_10.jpg,available,https://www.nazraeli.com/complete-catalogue/jack-teemer-rust-belt
Ed Templeton: 87 Drawings,,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-565-6

Hardcover, 9 x 11, 104 pages, 87 four-color plates. Introduction by Kim Hastreiter

""While sometimes overlooked due to his acclaim in other areas of art, drawing still lies at the heart of Ed Templeton’s practice. These multi-layered pen and ink scribbles, created almost automatically, have always been the place where Ed has worked out his issues. Both as an artist and in his relationship to the world."" —Aaron Rose

The images in Ed Templeton: 87 Drawings cover a span of over thirty years, from 1990 to 2021, and deliver a remarkable retrospective of the artist’s intimate drawing style. Templeton examines the studied ennui of adolescents and young adults, capturing his subjects’ specific personalities while documenting the visual identity born of the distinctive skating and surfing culture that originated in Southern California. He knows this culture well, growing up there before becoming a professional (and World Champion) skateboarder, contemporary artist, and photographer. His subjects are often drawn as portraits, their faces shown with a striking detail that contrasts with the simple lines of their bodies. Though they project a cool indifference, they are celebrated by the artist, whose fondness for them both recognizes and commends their subversive style. As Kim Hastreiter notes in the preface, his “secret ingredient is empathy.”

The collection also includes more personal drawings. There are eight of his wife and collaborator, Deanna; a self-portrait; and a drawing of them together. Fourteen of the drawings are on vintage hotel stationery, further anchoring the drawings in place, if not time. His grandfather collected much of the stationery; Templeton’s use of it adds a connective thread to both Southern California culture and his own life. Raised by his grandparents, Templeton credits his grandmother with exposing him to the art that would “enrich his life immensely,” and closes the book with a portrait of her at the end of her life.

87 Drawings is printed on natural textured art paper, and bound in cloth with a tipped-in reproduction and original silkscreen design by the artist. The first printing is limited to 2,000 copies.

A deluxe edition featuring an original letterpress artwork by Templeton, presented with a signed copy of the book in a clamshell box, is also available. The deluxe edition is limited to 20 signed and numbered copies.

***

There’s something about the artist Ed Templeton that makes me feel like he can’t help himself. Through his art we merely step into his eyes and see the often random people and circumstances he encounters on a daily basis, how he sees them. What you hold in your hands is what Templeton tells me is around his 21st book. It’s called 87 Drawings and is his first book solely dedicated to his drawings.

The title-page which serves as an impromptu subtitle for this book says: IATROGENIC CALAMITY. He explained to me the word “iatrogenic” means literally “an illness caused by a medical examination or treatment.” Ed loves this word because it represents the idea that the very thing you’re trying to do to help yourself is what harms you. Aha. When I asked him if he is a catastrophist, he tells me he has deep cynicism about the human race and always has the feeling that when something good happens, something bad will surely follow, adding a caveat that he also thinks good stuff can come out of catastrophes too. This book of drawings, conceived during the pandemic, is one of them and has everything closest to his heart in it: teenage smokers, punks, disaffected youth, those walls that define Huntington Beach to him. . . . Mixed into these pages are also the people most important to Ed in life. The very first drawing in the book is a nude sketch of a reclining Deanna he made as an 18-year-old in 1990. Seven more drawings of Deanna done over the past 30 years are also scattered throughout the book. She is obviously his North Star.

Contemporary Suburbium,Ed & Deanna Templeton,false,"""We were born into this situation, and made the best of what we were dealt, thriving on the sidewalks and front yards and hidden from the influence of the city until the city poured over the castle walls out into the surrounding suburbium that grew like barnacles along the edges... (Ed Templeton)

""We found ourselves in a tract of homes that felt familiar and safe. We wandered among the quiet dark tract housing, devoid of people, finally lying down together on a rectangle of grass wedged between the sidewalk and the street. We stared up at the stars talking until the sun came up."" (Deanna Templeton)

Contemporary Suburbium is a photographic meditation on living in the suburbs of Orange County, California — specifically, Huntington Beach, a seaside town on the outer extremities of the population surrounding Los Angeles. Once dotted with orange trees, oil drilling and summer cottages for the rich, Huntington Beach is now a popular beach destination for vacationers, and the old cottages are being replaced with tall modern three-story houses. The photographs in this book are a look at the people of this traditionally conservative stronghold, the disaffected youth, the fortunate (and less fortunate), as they venture out from behind fences, walls, and endless blocks of tract housing.

Reading like two opposing coming-of-age novellas about the same place, Contemporary Suburbium offers a gritty and sunbaked, yet romantic view of Southern California, and of the twenty-first century in its own adolescence.

Making full use of the book’s accordion-bound format, husband and wife Ed and Deanna Templeton present their own photographs and words in turn, printed back-to-back on the same sheets of paper, folded together between blue cloth covers in a die cut plastic slipcase.

Ed and Deanna Templeton’s photographs have been widely exhibited and published throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. This is Ed’s second, and Deanna’s first, book published by Nazraeli Press.

ALSO AVAILABLE as a special edition featuring two original, signed and numbered photographs in a custom clamshell box.

Hearing Voices,Dean Wareham With Ed Templeton,false,"“One of the great New York guitar sophisticates.” — Rolling Stone

Hearing Voices is a collection of lyrics by songwriting great Dean Wareham. Born in Wellington, New Zealand, Wareham moved to New York City as a teenager, in August 1977. It was here, in high school, that he met future bandmates Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang. All three went on to attend Harvard University, and in 1987 founded Galaxie 500, for which Wareham was the singer, guitarist and principal songwriter. Galaxie 500 released three albums (for Rough Trade) between 1987 and 1991 that have only grown in stature and influence. Wareham’s next band Luna recorded seven albums for Elektra and Beggar’s Banquet (including Penthouse, on Rolling Stone’s list of best albums of the 90s), followed by four albums as Dean & Britta (with wife Britta Phillips), and three simply as Dean Wareham, including his most recent album I Have Nothing to Say to the Mayor of L.A.

Hearing Voices is the first published collection of his lyrics, and is the result of a unique collaboration with the artist Ed Templeton, who created the illustrations for the book. Ed Templeton’s drawings, paintings and photographs have been widely exhibited and published in the United States, Europe and Asia. Hearing Voices is his fifth title with Nazraeli Press. The lyrics presented here span Dean’s entire career from Galaxie 500 and Luna to his recent solo work.

“Wareham always sounds like Dean Wareham—vulnerable, weary, faintly comical, unhoodwinkable—with a singing style heavily indebted to punk and post-punk, and an approach to the electric guitar that is lyrical without being showoffy.” — Rick Moody

“For erudite wit and dream tuneage, you won’t find better.” — Mojo Magazine

“Dean’s catalogue contains unimpeachable masterpieces.” — Uncut Magazine

“Galaxie 500 were the ultimate cult group, a band who set the stage for the indie scene of the 21st century.” — Bookforum

Drowned in a Dream,Susan A. Zadeh,false,"ISBN: 978-1-59005-503-8Hardcover, 9 x 12, 48 pages, 25 four-color plates.

A quintessential artist’s book, Drowned in a Dream comprises 25 photomontages by contemporary artist Susan A. Zadeh. Alternating between the slightly strange and fantastic, Zadeh’s seductive and unsettling imaginary landscapes prerecord the soft submersion of Holland into the seas while also serving as a sort of personal diary.

“Forever daydreaming . . . after 37 years of living in Amsterdam, it was about time to make this village mine,” the artist writes. The result, an ongoing photographic series of more than 500 images, formed the source for Drowned in a Dream, the first monograph devoted exclusively to Zadeh’s work.

Persian by ancestry and birth, Zadeh moved to France as a child, and then to Holland as a teenager. She has lived in Amsterdam ever since. Originally trained as a classical dancer, after a 12-year career at the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam she turned to photography and publishing. Zadeh became well-known as a champion of outsider artists through her seminal art magazine “Eyemazing”, which ran from 2002 to 2013 and which received a coveted Lucie Award. Since then, she has concentrated on her own work as an artist.

Produced in Holland and beautifully printed on matt art paper, Drowned in a Dream is bound in raw printer’s boards with an exposed spine. The first printing is limited to 500 slipcased copies, and is also available in a special edition with two signed original prints, and a deluxe edition with twelve signed original photographs printed by the artist.
