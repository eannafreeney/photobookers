After London;Simon Roberts;FALSE;"112pp, hardback with cloth spine, fine art paper, 237 x 300 mm.
Simon Roberts' dissolving portraits of a half-familiar London invite us to imagine a future transmuted by climate crisis. The city is de-peopled and eerie, its landmarks re-imagined as monuments to a displaced past. The photographs speak of loss, temporality and human fragility.

Simon Roberts is a British photographer renowned for his large-format, tableaux-style images that explore the relationship between people and landscape, focusing on themes of identity and belonging. Roberts has exhibited internationally, with his photographs held in major collections such as the George Eastman Museum and the V&A.

Benidorm;Rob Ball;FALSE;"128pp, cloth spine and back cover, 237mm x 285mm.
Considered the birthplace of the package holiday, Benidorm continues to draw visitors with its promise of tropical escape. Rob Ball's contemporary photographs reveal a more complex story: one of human connection and communion, and of the stark contrast between a vibrant beach culture and the towering urban landscape that embraces it.

Rob Ball has been a photographer for over 25 years. He spent time working as a news, sport and crime scene photographer before shifting to long-form personal projects while lecturing at Canterbury Christ Church University. Rob has exhibited his work internationally and continues to work on projects and commissions while lecturing.

The Hackney Marshes;Freya Najade;FALSE;"96pp, cloth bound cover, 237mm x 285mm. With an introduction by Rosalind Jana.
Freya Najade takes us on a journey through the uncontainable wildness of the Hackney Marshes; an explosion of nature in the heart of the city, where ancient trees and grasslands are overlooked by tower blocks and pylons. Following the meadows and riverbanks, abandoned infrastructure and football pitches, Najade documents the magic of these overgrown spaces and the people who seek refuge there.

The Office;Steven Ahlgren;FALSE;"112pp, cloth spine, 206mm x 156mm. With an introduction by Ufrieda Ho.
As many of us question the necessity of working from an office, this photographic series – taken in the days before wifi and iPhones – is a poignant reminder of how things once were. Teetering stacks of paper, off-kilter filing cabinets, gum-white computer monitors and the cold glow of the Xerox machine; what were once essential tools now stand as whimsical relics to a former life. The office holds bittersweet memories of kitchen small talk, cheap coffee, awkward Christmas parties and promotions won or lost. Capturing this corporate world with a tender yet satirical eye, American photographer Steven Ahlgren’s nostalgic series will resonate with anyone who has ever loved, hated or simply endured office life.

Steven Ahlgren’s photographs have been exhibited in museums and galleries in the US and abroad and published in many magazines including The New York Times. He currently lives in Media, Pennsylvania.

Déjà View;Martin Parr;FALSE;"144pp, hardback,  205 x 155mm.
This book is a playful conversation between two important bodies of photographic work. Each spread of Déjà View pairs one of Martin Parr’s iconic snapshots with an image from The Anonymous Project’s collection of found amateur photographs taken between the 1950s and 80s. These unnervingly similar ‘twin’ pictures remind us of photography’s greatest power: to intimately preserve everyday moments of humour, warmth, ennui and absurdity.

Martin Parr is one of Britain’s most esteemed and well-loved photographers; he has published around 40 solo photobooks and has been a member of Magnum Photos for nearly 30 years.

The Anonymous Project is dedicated to collecting and preserving mid-century colour slides from around the world. Started in 2017 by filmmaker Lee Shulman, the project brings to light Kodachrome memories that might otherwise be lost forever.

Revival;Roy Mehta;FALSE;"96pp, cloth spine, 190 x 240mm. Photography by Roy Mehta. Introduction by Caryl Phillips.
Brent has a rich history of multiculturalism. Roy Mehta’s exquisite black and white photographs capture the daily rituals of its various communities, most notably the Afro-Caribbean and Irish, engaged in seemingly simple activities at home, in the street and at church. Shot from 1989–1993, the images move from profound moments of faith to quiet family settings to the noisy streets outside, reminding us of the continual opportunities for connection and reflection in everyday life.

‘Mehta doesn’t shy away from the sadness and difficulties of this foundational story, but his multiracial faces – taken in Brent, northwest London – remain coloured with British dreams, and they exude a vitality which suggests that, although things are never going to be easy, all will eventually be well.’ – Caryl Phillips from the introduction

Roy Mehta is a well-established London-based photographic artist with thirty years of professional experience working on personal and commercial projects. This is his third book.

This is the first edition.

In Your Face;Paul Trevor;FALSE;"128pp, cloth spine, 222mm x 160mm.
Paul Trevor’s extreme close-ups, made spontaneously on the streets of east London, capture Britain’s perennial social divide. They contrast the people in The City with those in the nearby market of Brick Lane. Shot during Thatcher’s reign, the imagery is as fresh and relevant today as it was then.

‘This series is a new twist on the street photo, but totally unlike anything I have seen before or since.’ – Martin Parr

Paris, China;François Prost;FALSE;"88pp, paperback, 162mm x 127mm.
Tianducheng is a small suburb in China modelled on Paris — it even has a replica Eiffel Tower. These photographs of near-identical landmarks in both places beg the question: is imitation really the highest form of flattery?

François Prost is a Parisian photographer, graphic designer and art director. When he’s not working for editorial or commercial clients he spends his time on personal photography projects, documenting façades of local French nightclubs, machine gun shops in the US and Chinese scooters. In 2020 he started photographing the similarities between the real Venice and replicas in Las Vegas and Hangzhou, China.

Sunday Best;Katie Waggett;FALSE;"176pp, hardback, 151mm x 199mm.
In the wake of a terror attack and determined not to let the voices of separatism win out, photographer Katie Waggett embarked on an intimate survey of London’s many religions. Her portraits of individuals in their most colourful religious outfits are accompanied by personal quotes, as well interiors from the places of worship. Sunday Best is a feast of colour and a love letter to a city that so depends on diversity for its survival.

‘As we tend to get caught up in the current climate of fear and hostility, Sunday Best reminds us to stop and think, to look beyond the surface and to challenge what we think we know about others.’ – Jilke Golbach, from the introduction

Katie Waggett is an award-winning documentary photographer based in London. Her work has been exhibited internationally.

*Please note: the book features a selection of images from Joshua's collection, not all 462 launderettes. That would be a very fat book...

Joshua Blackburn is a London-based photographer, print maker and co-founder of The Artful Project gallery. In his previous life, he ran a graphic design agency for 14 years. Joshua runs the popular Instagram account: @coinop_london.

Twins;Peter Zelewski;FALSE;"96pp, cloth hardback, uncoated paper, 163mm x 210mm.
Picked as one of Buzzfeed's Best Photography Books from 2018. Also featured in the Guardian.

Peter Zelewski has spent years capturing the faces and stories of identical twins. Some inexplicably lost their hearing at the exact same time, others unlock each others’ phones with their indistinguishable fingerprints, but perhaps more surprisingly, some don’t get on. These powerful portraits tap into one of the most fascinating of all human relationships.

Peter Zelewski is a London-based portrait and documentary photographer. Born in Detroit, USA, he moved to London in the 1980s and studied at the London College of Communication (LCC). His portraiture concentrates primarily on the exploration of people, culture and urban life.

His previous book, People of London, was also published by Hoxton Mini Press.

With an introduction by Naomi and Alexandria Hewston (featured in the book).

'People of London' by Peter Zelewski.

This is book 1 from a series dedicated to the best urban photography from around the world. The books are similar to our grey-spined series but 20% bigger with cloth wrapped around the back. Even better!

With his mother having grown up just off the Caledonian Road and family full of Arsenal supporters, London has always been in his blood. Peter’s unique style of street portraiture has earned him a place of numerous publications and exhibitions including at the National Portrait Gallery, London. Peter divides his time between commercial photography and self-initiated portraiture projects.

Bored Tourists;Laurence Stephens;FALSE;"112pp, paperback with French flaps, fine art paper, 162mm x 127mm.
Discover a lost civilisation.Gaze up at a towering cathedral.Take a selfie in front of a kebab shop.Ever had a holiday that wasn't what you hoped for?

What began as a chance visit to Barcelona Cathedral to escape the mid-August sun, led photographer Laurence Stephens to spend the next three summers traversing the cultural landscapes of Spain and Portugal. From stuffy museums to breathtaking skylines, with camera in hand, he went in search of the not-so-elusive bored tourist.

Laurence Stephens is a British documentary photographer. Inspired by colour photographers of the 1980s, his approach is anthropological, exploring aspects of modern life with a satirical eye.

Men Photographing Women in the 70s;Michael Abramson;FALSE;"96pp, paperback, pink foil, 175 x 120mm.
Once a month, in 1970s Chicago, men were allowed to take cameras into underground strip clubs. Michael Abramson, a local photographer, thought it would be more revealing to photograph the men photographing the women. Left in a drawer until now, the resulting images are a fascinating, funny and at times unsettling portrayal of the uninhibited male gaze.

Introduced by Midge Wilson.

Michael Abramson (1948-2011) was an American photographer best known for his work documenting the nightlife of black night clubs on the south side of Chicago. His photographs can be found in the permanent collections of many major American institutions including the Smithsonian, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago History Museum, the California Museum of Photography and more.

Hackney Studios;Jenny Lewis;FALSE;"116pp, hardcover with tip-in image, white and gold foiled, 220 x 265 mm landscape
Hackney, East London, is well known for its vibrant creative community. Jenny Lewis spent four years in and out of studios across the borough photographing a tribe of artists who over time have defined the area. Painters, illustrators, filmmakers, jewellers, ceramicists and fashion designers invite us into their studios and share their private thoughts about the creative process.

What began with a chance encounter with fashion designer Isobel Webster grew organically into a ‘family tree’ of the borough’s creative community, with each artist nominating the next person to be photographed.

Lewis notes that many of the artists featured in the project have since been forced to leave their studios due to recent steep rent increases, and as such, hopes this book will stand as a timely reminder and celebration of the spirit of creativity in one of London’s most dynamic areas.

Jenny Lewis moved to Hackney over twenty years ago via a spell at Preston University where she acquired a Fine Art degree and a husband. Since then she has made her living as an editorial photographer but continues to pursue a range of personal work. Much of this centres on her experience of living and working in East London. Her first book, 'One Day Young', is also published by Hoxton Mini Press.

This is the first edition.

Badly Repaired Cars;Ronni Campana;FALSE;"72pp hardcover with tip-in image and foiled titling, 173 x 135 mm
SELECTED AS ONE OF MARTIN PARR'S BEST PHOTOBOOKS OF 2016

Badly Repaired Cars is a bright, bold and humorous documentation of some of the best (or worst) examples of DIY car repairs. Close up photographs of cars held together by tape, plastic and glue fill each frame and begin to take on the qualities of abstract art. A strip of duct tape across a broken headlight becomes powerfully graphic in form; green plastic hanging from a door divides the frame like a Rothko colour wash.

This is Book 2 in a series that celebrates the best in colourful, modern photography.

Born in Milan in 1987, photographer Ronni Campana specialises in photographing the world’s minute imperfections. By concentrating on details in his surrounding environment and framing contrasting colour and shapes he uncovers an abstract beauty in seemingly mundane objects. With the use of subtle humour and a bright flash he draws our attention to the wonderful flaws found in everyday life. This is his first book.

This is the first edition.

Bubblegum;Emily Stein;FALSE;"102pp hardcover with tip-in image and foiled titling, 173 x 135 mm
Emily Stein's photographs of children blowing bubblegum on beaches around the world are a portrait of the freedom, innocence and joy of youth. The range of facial expressions as the children blow the gum – frustration, excitement, surprise, concentration – tell a story in themselves.

This is Book 1 in a series that celebrates the best in colourful, modern photography.

Emily Stein started taking photographs in the last term of her Fine Art degree. Never able to concentrate for long enough to finish a painting, she picked up a camera and immediately fell in love with photography. Taking pictures enabled her two great loves: going on adventures and meeting new people. These days she photographs people of all ages, often for commercial clients such as MTV, Vice and Puma, and has a natural gift for capturing their energy and individuality.

This is the first edition.
